// P4 — the lobby → engine handoff (online.md). When a lobby's countdown ends with
// both players ready, the DO starts a real match: it instantiates the P3 engine
// server-side and owns the RNG seed + hidden info. This module is the seam.
//
// The lobby has no p1/p2 concept — seats are "host"/"guest" — so the mapping to the
// engine's Seat is minted HERE, at match start: the host is p1, the guest is p2.
// Kept pure (no DO/storage/D1) so it unit-tests without a Worker: the DO loads the
// card pool from D1 (`loadCardPool`) and calls `startMatch`, then persists + redacts
// the result.
