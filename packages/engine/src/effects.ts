// The effect-op vocabulary (D8's "primitive ops authored as data") and the
// conservative text→ops deriver. M3 shipped the first sliver — status/heal
// ops derived from exact attack sentences. M4 grows the union with the board
// and deck ops that Trainers and Abilities need (draw, search, switch, gust,
// heal-a-chosen-Pokémon) and moves EXECUTION into a shared, resumable
// interpreter (interpreter.ts) that both attacks and card plays run through.
//
// This module stays PURE data: the op union (below) plus `deriveAttackEffect`
// (printed text → ops, unchanged from M3). It knows nothing about GameState —
// interpreter.ts owns every state transition and the mid-effect decision
// parking. Registry-authored programs (registry.ts) are the same op arrays,
// just hand-written instead of text-derived, and sit ABOVE the deriver at the
// one attack call site (`programFor(id).attack ?? deriveAttackEffect(text)`).
