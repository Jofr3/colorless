// GameEvents are the animation and wire contract (simulator.md): semantic
// "what happened" facts, never "how to render" instructions. Every state
// change the reducer makes is described by the events it returns alongside.
// M1 events are full-information — hidden-info filtering is P4's job.
//
// Payload arrays are always COPIES, never the state's own arrays or the
// caller's action arrays: an event is a value handed to consumers (animators,
// the P4 broadcast, a persisted log), and a consumer that sorts or splices one
// must not be able to reach back into game state or into a retained snapshot.
