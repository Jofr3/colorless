# Workstream: Simulator Engine (Phase 3)

Goal: replicate a real game of the Pokémon TCG well enough to play — first
approximately, then more accurately each pass. Reused by online matches (P4).

**Depends on:** P2 (real, usable decks) and `reference/ptcg-rules.md`.

## Approach
1. **Rules first.** `reference/ptcg-rules.md` (researched by a sub-agent) is the
   spec: setup, turn structure, zones, status conditions, KO/prizes, win
   conditions, first-turn restrictions, weakness/resistance math.
2. **Deterministic core.** A pure, seedable state machine:
   `GameState → Action → GameState` (+ emitted events for the UI/log). No
   randomness except a **seeded RNG** (shuffle, coin flips) so games are
   replayable and testable.
3. **Composable, data-driven card effects.** Most cards are minor variations on a
   few archetypes, so effects are authored as **data** — parameterized primitive
   ops over shared templates, not one function per card — and every op emits a
   semantic **event** the UI animates. Full design in the next section.
4. **State shape** builds on the existing playmat types
   (`src/features/playmat/types.ts`: BoardState, PlayerBoard, CardModel, zones)
   and the canonical `Card` (D5).

## Card-effect system — composable & data-driven

Most cards are minor variations on a **small set of effect archetypes**, so the
engine models effects as **composable primitives authored as data**, not a
bespoke function per card. Four layers:

1. **Primitive ops (`EffectOp`)** — the engine's instruction set: `Damage`,
   `ModifyDamage`, `PlaceDamageCounters`, `Heal`, `HealStatus`, `ApplyStatus`,
   `DrawCards`, `SearchDeck`, `Shuffle`, `AttachEnergy`, `DiscardEnergy`,
   `MoveCard`, `Switch`, `CoinFlip`, `ForEach`, `Conditional`, … Each op is a
   pure `(GameState, Ctx) → GameState` **and emits a semantic event** (below).
2. **Selectors & filters** — declarative targets (`self`, `opponentActive`,
   `yourBench`, `allYourPokemonMatching(filter)`, `playerChooses(filter)`) and
   card predicates (category / type / stage / isBasic / nameTag / energyCount…).
   Parameters, not code.
3. **Card effects as programs** — an attack is
   `{ cost, baseDamage, ops: EffectOp[] }`; an ability is
   `{ trigger, timing, oncePerTurn?, ops }`; a trainer / special energy is
   `{ provides?, ops }`. The whole effect is a small **data tree**.
4. **Archetype templates** — named builders for the common shapes, so a new card
   in a known family is one line of params:
   - `ballSearch({ cost, filter, dest })` → Nest / Great / Ultra / Quick / Level Ball
   - `handRefresh({ mode })` → Iono / Judge / Marnie / N
   - `gust()` → Boss's Orders-likes · `coinFlipDamage({ base, perHeads, flips })`
   - `energyAccelFromDiscard({ filter, target })`, …

### Grounded in real tcgdex data (fetched live)

| Card | tcgdex `effect` | Op program |
|---|---|---|
| Nest Ball | "Search your deck for a Basic Pokémon, put it on your Bench, shuffle." | `SearchDeck(filter=BasicPokémon, dest=Bench)` → `Shuffle` — the shared **ball** archetype |
| Gardevoir ex · *Psychic Embrace* | "…attach a Basic {P} Energy from discard to 1 of your {P} Pokémon… put 2 damage counters on it…" | ability: `AttachEnergy(from=Discard, filter=BasicP, target=chooseYourP)` → `PlaceDamageCounters(sameTarget, 2)`, guarded `notIfWouldKO` |
| Pikachu ex · *Thunderbolt* | "Discard all Energy from this Pokémon." | attack `baseDamage:150` → `DiscardEnergy(self, all)` |
| Iono's Voltorb · *Voltaic Chain* | damage `"20+"`: "+20 for each {L} Energy on all your Iono's Pokémon." | attack `baseDamage:20` → `ModifyDamage(+20 × count(energy=L, on=allYour(nameTag="Iono's")))` |
| Jet Energy | "provides {C}… when attached to a Benched Pokémon, switch it to Active." | special energy `provides:[C]`, onAttach: `Switch(attached → Active)` |

Notes:
- The **`damage` field encodes an op**: numeric = `baseDamage`; the `+` / `×` /
  `?` markers (`"20+"`) mean the attack also carries a `ModifyDamage` or
  `CoinFlip` op.
- The raw `effect` / `ability.effect` text is stored at ingest and is the
  **source a human or an LLM reads to author the op program** — tcgdex does not
  provide the program itself. (Ingest must persist `abilities` text too — add an
  `abilities_json` column to the `cards` table in `backend-data.md`.)

### Coverage strategy
Op programs are keyed by card id. A **structured fallback** derives what's purely
mechanical from the data alone (cost, base damage, weakness / resistance,
retreat, plain energy provision), so an un-authored card stays **playable** with
its text-effect flagged "not simulated" rather than guessed. Authoring programs
across the pool is a natural **Workflow** fan-out (batch by set; an LLM drafts
the op program from the effect text, each verified against
`reference/ptcg-rules.md`).

### Events → animation (built in, not bolted on)
The reducer returns `(GameState, GameEvent[])`. Every primitive emits
**semantic, serializable events** — `DAMAGE`, `ENERGY_ATTACHED`, `CARDS_DRAWN`,
`SEARCH`, `COIN_FLIP`, `SWITCH`, `STATUS_APPLIED`, `DAMAGE_COUNTERS_PLACED`,
`KNOCKOUT`, `PRIZE_TAKEN`, … The engine stays pure and knows nothing about
rendering.

- **Web:** an `animation[eventType]` registry maps each event to a playmat
  animation (the existing Pixi / GSAP layer). Adding or changing an animation is
  a registry entry — **no engine change**.
- **Online (P4):** the DO broadcasts the same event stream (hidden-info-filtered
  per player); clients animate identically. Local and online share one pipeline.

This is why the composable model pays off twice: it makes **authoring** cards
cheap (params over templates) and makes **animation** a pure consumer of the
event stream.

---

## Testing
- Unit tests per rule (KO → take prize, weakness ×2, status timing, deck-out
  loss…) and **scripted end-to-end games** with a fixed seed.
- The action/event log doubles as test fixtures and as the online wire format.

## Milestones
1. ✅ **Core state machine** — setup, turn phases, draw, energy attach, retreat,
   pass. Built + reviewed 2026-07-14 (commit `d34146c`); as-built notes below.
2. ✅ **Attacks** — costs, damage, weakness/resistance, KO + prize-taking, win
   check. Built + xhigh-reviewed + fixed 2026-07-16; as-built notes below. The
   **engine → playmat projection** (D17, `src/features/game/projection.ts`)
   landed alongside it. **Wire-up done 2026-07-17:** the projection drives a
   playable local hot-seat game at `/play` ("Wire-up as built" below).
3. ✅ **Status conditions + Pokémon Checkup** — built + reviewed (8 finders /
   7 verifiers, 10 reported findings all fixed) 2026-07-17; as-built notes
   below. Includes the first sliver of the effect system: the **text-derived
   status deriver** (D20).
4. 🚧 **Evolution + Trainers + Abilities + persistent zones + KO generalized
   off the Active done** (2026-07-17/18; as-built below). The effect-op
   interpreter/registry drives real Item/Supporter Trainers and activated +
   passive Abilities; slice 3 added the shared **Stadium** zone + Pokémon
   **Tool** attachment with a **continuous-modifier pipeline** (continuous.ts);
   slice 4 generalized the Knock Out off the Active — **bench spread/snipe
   damage** and a **mid-turn KO that resumes the actor's turn** (closing the
   evolve-below-HP gap); slice 5 added **Special Energy** — provision as data
   (multi-unit + wildcard), a wildcard-aware cost matcher, and on-attach effects
   (Jet Energy's switch); slice 6 added **triggered Abilities** (§9) at three
   scan points (on-play-to-Bench, on-evolve, between-turns/Checkup) — board
   triggers park on effect:choose, a between-turns counter KOs through the
   Checkup sweep; slice 7 added **Rare Candy** (§7.1) — the Basic→Stage 2
   evolve-skip Item, a dedicated action reusing the extracted `placeEvolution`
   (so it inherits carry-over, the on-evolve trigger and the mid-turn KO), with
   the Basic→Stage 2 link resolved by bridging through the Stage 1 name in the
   pool. Remaining: on-KO triggers, the mid-turn-damage snipe.
5. Coverage-expansion pass(es) across the SV-era pool; track % simulated.
6. Harden for authoritative server use (P4): validation, hidden info, server-owned
   RNG seed.

---

## M1 as built (`packages/engine`, 2026-07-14)

**Shape.** `createGame({seed, decks, cardPool})` → `{ok, state, events}`;
`applyAction(state, action)` → `{ok:true, state, events} | {ok:false, error}`.
Pure, JSON-safe `GameState` (mulberry32 `rngState` lives *in* it), no classes,
no wall clock. Illegal actions never throw and never mutate — the P4
authoritative server rests on that. Modules: `rng · types · events · actions ·
cards · setup · turn · index` (+ `testFixtures`). 60 tests.

**Locked design (D14).** Seats `p1|p2` are labels, not turn order (the coin
winner *chooses* via an action; `firstPlayer` records it). Every physical card
gets a uid (`"p1#0"`); zones hold uids; `cardIdByUid` + `cardPool` resolve them.
Choices are actions; anything with no choice (mulligan redraws, prize setting,
the turn-start draw) auto-resolves inside the reducer. `Phase` is the
discriminant every action validates against.

**Wire-safety rule (learned the hard way).** TypeScript types are *not* input
validation: P4 decodes actions from a client, so anything the engine reads off
an action must be checked at runtime. The review found three live bugs of
exactly this shape — a string `"1"` bench index passed `bench[index]` (string
key!) but failed `i === index`, destroying the energy card; retreat's
`slice(index + 1)` string-concatenated to `slice("11")` and deleted benched
Pokémon; and an unvalidated `first` seat crashed several actions later inside
`startTurn`. **Every new M2+ action must runtime-check its indices, seats and
counts** (`isBenchIndex`, the `isSeat` guard in `applyAction`).

**Event contract.** Events are values handed to consumers (animator, P4
broadcast, persisted log): payload arrays are always **copies**, never the
state's own arrays or the caller's action arrays. Every state change emits an
event — including a phase advance with no other effect (`COMPENSATION_DECIDED`
fires even when the player declines, or an event-only client hangs on the
prompt).

### Known gaps / traps for M2+
- **The turn tail is fused.** `endTurn` does TURN_ENDED → `runCheckup` (an M3
  no-op stub) → `startTurn(other)` in one reduction, and `runCheckup` is
  `GameState → GameState` so it **cannot pause**. M2's KO resolution needs to
  stop mid-sequence for decisions (which prize, which Pokémon to promote), and
  M2's attack ends the turn through the same tail. Expect to restructure this
  into a resumable/staged transition rather than fill in the stub.
- **Per-turn allowances live on the `turn:action` phase object** ("replacing the
  phase IS the reset"). Any mid-turn *interrupt* phase (targeting, prize pick,
  search) destroys them. When M2 adds interrupts, lift the allowances to a
  per-turn struct on `GameState` — where the supporter/stadium flags and the
  per-Pokémon once-per-turn ability flags (§15.J) belong anyway.
- **`gameOver.winner` is `Seat`** — §14 wants a `TIE`/`SUDDEN_DEATH` outcome
  surfaced, not silently picked. Widen when M2 lands simultaneous KOs. Nothing
  consumes the union yet, so it is still free to change.
- **Retreat's energy-discard is hand-rolled.** M2's KO (whole stack + energy +
  tools → discard) and the `DiscardEnergy` effect op need the same move — lift a
  shared "attached cards → discard" primitive rather than a third copy.
- **`retreatCostOf` maps `null` → 0 (free retreat).** In the real catalog `null`
  is a *data gap*, not a printed 0 (ingest writes null when tcgdex omits it), so
  a bad row silently becomes a free-retreat Pokémon. Fix belongs at ingest.
- **`drawToHand` short-draws silently** when the deck is shallower than `count`.
  M1's callers are safe (compensation is clamped so a player can never draw below
  their 6 prizes), but M2 draw effects (Professor's Research…) must not assume.
- **`resolveMulligans` has no iteration cap** — a legal 1-Basic deck loops until
  it draws the Basic (expected ~9 rounds, exponential tail). Accepted: capping it
  has no legal resolution.
- **No `SETUP_REVEALED` payload, and no stadium / Lost Zone zones yet.** The
  first matters for P4's hidden-info filter (the face-down placements are exactly
  what gets redacted, and the reveal must say what became public); the second
  lands with M4's trainers.
- **No engine → playmat projection exists.** `GameState` (uids + pool
  indirection) is deliberately not the playmat's `BoardState` (`CardModel[]`).
  The web app cannot render a game until that adapter is written — it is the
  natural next slice alongside M2.
- **`isBasicPokemon` now exists twice** in the repo: the engine's (over the
  canonical `Card.stage`) and the builder's (over `BuilderCard.subtype`, a
  relabelled view). They read different vocabularies of the same data and can
  drift. Lift one predicate into `@luminous/schema` when convenient.

## M2 as built (2026-07-16) — attacks, KO/prizes, win check + the projection

**Shape (D16).** The fused turn tail is gone: `GameState.pending` is a
`PendingStage[]` queue drained by `advance()` in the new `flow.ts`. Decision
stages **park** (phase becomes `ko:takePrizes`/`ko:promote`, prompt event
fires) or **auto-resolve** when forced; `attack` seeds its KO stages ahead of
the shared `turnTail(seat)` triple; `resolvePrizesAndResume`/
`resolvePromotionAndResume` own the resolve → pop → **win-check** → resume
sequence for BOTH the action handlers and advance's auto-resolves (the §14
check runs in exactly one place). Per-turn allowances live on
`GameState.allowances` (M4's supporter/stadium flags go there). `gameOver`
carries `GameOutcome` (win/tie). New actions `attack`/`takePrizes`/`promote`;
new events ATTACK_DECLARED, ATTACK_EFFECT_SKIPPED (the "not simulated" flag),
DAMAGE_DEALT (with `DamageModifier` breakdown), KNOCKED_OUT, PRIZES_OWED/
PRIZES_TAKEN, PROMOTION_REQUIRED/POKEMON_PROMOTED. The **projection** (D17)
maps `GameState` → playmat `BoardState` per viewer: `activePlayer` (turn
owner) vs `waitingOn` (who must act) are separate fields — during
`ko:promote` they differ, and a HUD gating on turn ownership alone soft-locks.

**M1 traps closed by M2:** the fused tail (staged queue), phase-object
allowances (lifted to state), `gameOver.winner` (widened to `GameOutcome`),
the hand-rolled retreat discard (shared `discardFromStack`, which returns the
moved uids in **pile order** — events must report that order, it's the §2
contract KNOCKED_OUT/RETREATED both follow now).

**The xhigh review paid again** (10 finder angles + 9 verifiers + sweep; 15
findings, all confirmed ones fixed in-session). The headline classes:
- **Never-throw violations in M1 code the M1 review missed:** `attachEnergy`
  read `action.target.spot` unguarded (a `null` target THREW out of
  `applyAction` — probe-proven) and retreat's `discardEnergy` lacked
  `Array.isArray` (`{length:1}` passed the length check then `new Set` threw).
  Both now runtime-checked (`BAD_TARGET`; the takePrizes-style array guard).
  Lesson repeated: **every object an action carries needs a shape check, not
  just its leaves.**
- **Name/format parsing vs real catalog data:** `energyProvidesOf` misparsed
  the catalog's own "Basic Darkness/Metal Energy" prints (sv06.5-098/099) to
  Colorless — typed attacks permanently unpayable on legal boards; and the
  schema-documented additive weakness `"+20"` was silently applied as ×2
  (dp5-4 fixture proves it). Fixes: optional "Basic " prefix + the canonical
  `BASIC_ENERGY_TYPES` now lives in **`@luminous/schema`** (builder derives
  its palette from it; Fairy added, Dragon correctly provides nothing), and
  weakness/resistance parse to `DamageModifier` (×N/+N/−N).
- **Data gaps must not guess:** `hp ≤ 0` now reads as the null data gap (a
  literal 0 was instant-KOing undamaged Pokémon on 0-damage attacks).

### Known gaps / traps for M3+
- ~~**`runCheckup` is still a stub.**~~ **Closed by M3** (2026-07-17): the
  shared `knockOut` + `isLethallyDamaged` + `activeTop` now live in
  flow.ts/cards.ts and both attack exits + the checkup use them. ~~Still
  Active-only — M4 bench damage must generalize `knockOut`'s target.~~
  **Generalized in M4 slice 4** (2026-07-18): `knockOut` KOs any in-play
  Pokémon by uid and the shared `collectKnockOuts` sweep serves attack /
  checkup / mid-turn alike.
- **`prizeValueOf` returns 1 for everything** — the canonical `Card` has no
  ex/rule-box field because ingest deliberately drops tcgdex's `suffix`
  (wrongly lumped with dp-era extras in `apps/api/src/db/catalog.ts`). The
  multi-prize flow (validation, count clamp, taking N) is already built and
  tested; persisting the suffix at ingest is the single point of change.
- **Energy provision is still name-derived** (special energies conservatively
  provide 1 Colorless). Real fix at ingest: provision as data on the Card.
  Same for weakness/resistance value normalization (`DamageModifier` could be
  computed at ingest) — engine parsing is documented debt.
- **phase ↔ `pending[0]` dual encoding kept** (the parked phase mirrors the
  queue head). Handlers cross-check and reject `PHASE_DESYNC` on mismatch;
  unreachable via the public API today. M3 may collapse to a single encoding
  (park by popping the stage into the phase) if it adds interrupt writers.
- **Sudden death is surfaced, not played out** — simultaneous §14 wins return
  `GameOutcome tie`; an actual sudden-death sub-game is future work.
- **Projection deferrals:** opponent-hand backs use positional ids
  (`opponent-hand-N`) that re-key when the hand shrinks — correct redaction,
  wrong animation identity for opponent plays; fixing needs stable **opaque**
  aliases designed together with P4's server-side filter. `image: null`
  projects `imageUrl: undefined` → the playmat's grey placeholder; nothing
  maps backs/undefined to a card-back texture yet (belongs to the wire-up
  slice). Status conditions + lower stack cards have no CardModel slot.
- ~~The playmat still renders `mockPlaymat.ts`~~ — **closed by the /play
  wire-up (2026-07-17, below).** (Historical note: D17/progress once cited a
  "consumption sketch in the projection module" — no such code block ever
  existed; the consumption guidance is the projection's inline comments.)

## Wire-up as built (2026-07-17) — the playable local game page

**Shape.** `/play` (`src/features/game/GamePage.tsx`) is a hot-seat local
match: pregame (demo decks + saved decks when signed in) → `createGame` →
`LocalMatch` renders **`PlaymatView`** (the presentational shell extracted
from `Playmat.tsx`; the mock at `/simulator` — retitled "Sandbox" — is now a
thin wrapper driver) purely from `projectGameState`. `useLocalGame` owns
`GameState` via a pure reducer over `applyAction` (ok → replace state, append
log via `logFromEvents`, clear `lastError`; err → nonce'd `lastError`); the
hot-seat **viewer follows `waitingOn`** (device flip; `waitingSeatOf` ≡
`phaseViewOf(state, seat).waitingSeat ?? seat` — ONE source, D17). Drags
translate via `moveToAction` (gesture-class routing; the ENGINE is the
authority) and drop affordances obey a **driver-supplied
`PlacementPredicate`** (D19) built by `gamePlacementPredicate` in lockstep
with the translator (property-tested: every afforded drop translates to a
real action). `GameHud` is ONE exhaustive phase switch (coin toss, mulligan
draw, placement, turn panel w/ engine-helper payability, prize/promote
dialogs, game-over overlay), everything gated on `waitingOn === "you"`.
`cardPool` (`src/features/game/cardPool.ts`) builds the engine pool via
`GET /cards/:id` fan-out (D18 — CardBrief deliberately lacks combat blobs);
module-level promise cache, 404s = stable `missing`. Demo decks: 60-card
sv01+sve-era Fire vs Water lists, ids verified live. The **projection now
redacts the opponent's in-play Pokémon during `setup:*`** (positional
`-hidden` ids, no `pokemon` rows — the same filter P4's server applies;
reveal re-keys, same trade as hand backs).

**Browser-verified e2e** (recipe + agent-browser traps in
`.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`): full game — setup drags, hot-seat flips
with setup redaction, energy attach, payability gating, weakness ×2 math,
KO → prize dialog → forced auto-promote, win-by-no-Pokémon overlay; damage
chips confirmed painting above the Pixi canvas (stacking-context walk).

**The React lesson of the session:** two fragment siblings shared
`key={seatKey}` in GameHud — on key change React's `mapRemainingChildren`
dedupes by key, the shadowed old fiber is NEVER deleted, and it stays
mounted-but-orphaned: stale content, **live buttons dispatching real
actions**, zero console errors. Keys among siblings must be unique across
the WHOLE fragment child list, not per slot; the phase-switch composition now
makes the collision structurally impossible. Regression-pinned in
`LocalMatch.dom.test.tsx`.

### /play follow-ups (from the 8-finder/6-verifier review — all verified)
- **P4 blocker (do with P4, not before):** the HUD reads raw `GameState`
  (allowances, `phase.owed`, energy uids — verbatim copies of
  `attack.ts`/`turn.ts` internals for payability/retreat). Online clients
  can never receive GameState; the fix is engine-exported preview predicates
  or a projection "available actions" surface. Acknowledged in-code.
- **Piles are a second render path:** discard-top is a DOM `<img>`; deck-empty
  hides the Pixi back by dropping its anchor. Cards **teleport** to discard
  (KO/retreat/M4 trainers) — needs pile zones in the animation layer's model.
- ~~`CardModel` carries no battle state~~ — **closed by M3** (D21): the
  projection attaches `battle {damage, hp, conditions}`; the side-table and
  its 5-hop prop chain are deleted.
- Perf (minor, verified): `viewLogEntries` re-maps the whole log per action
  (O(n²)); overlay banner/pill timers re-render the board subtree (Pixi sync
  is skipped via board identity — cost is reconciliation + payability
  recompute); per-slot deck→pool fetch pipelining.
- Pregame could reuse `useDeckLibrary` (hand-rolled listDecks effect swallows
  failures silently; judgment call — the hook also fetches /folders).
- Hidden-back re-key on reveal (opponent hand AND setup redaction) pops
  instead of animating — needs the stable-opaque-alias design with P4's
  server filter (pre-existing deferral, now with two call sites).

## M3 as built (2026-07-17) — special conditions, checkup, text-derived effects

**Shape.** The M1-reserved `SpecialConditions` slot (`rotation` ∈
none/asleep/paralyzed/confused, `poisonDamage` counter amount with 0 = not
poisoned, `burned`) is now live on the Active only. The checkup runs entirely
inside `advance`'s `checkup` stage (which now carries the ended `seat`) — **no
new Phase members**: §13 order poison → burn(20 + cure flip) → asleep(wake
flip) → paralysis(ended seat only), each step [endedSeat, other], all flips
threading `rngState`, KOs resolved AFTER the whole batch via the shared
**`knockOut(state, koedSeat, prizeSeat, events)`** (lifted from attack.ts;
prize goes to the KO'd side's opponent) parking on the same ko:* interrupts as
attack KOs — prize stages grouped before promote stages. Double-KO
simultaneous wins resolve by **speculatively applying both KOs + owed prizes
and asking `evaluateWin`** (§14 stays single-sourced) → tie. Gates:
`isImmobilized` (engine-exported; asleep/paralyzed) blocks attack + retreat
(`STATUS_PREVENTS_ATTACK`/`_RETREAT`); Confused attacks flip
(CONFUSION_CHECK; tails → ATTACK_FAILED + 30 self-counters + possible
self-KO prized to the defender + turn ends) through the same shared
`finishAttack` epilogue as the normal exit. Retreat/benching cures (emits
STATUS_CLEARED reason "benched"); a rotation status REPLACES the previous one
with no clear event. Effects: **D20's `deriveAttackEffect`** (5 anchored
sentence patterns → `EffectStep[]`: applyStatus/heal/coinFlipGate) executes
after damage, before the KO check; underivable text keeps ATTACK_EFFECT_SKIPPED
(whose `effect` is null when the text DID derive and only a damage marker was
skipped — the log keys on that). New events: STATUS_APPLIED, STATUS_CLEARED,
COUNTERS_PLACED (poison/burn/confusion), CHECKUP_COIN_FLIP, CONFUSION_CHECK,
ATTACK_FAILED, HEALED, ATTACK_EFFECT_COIN_FLIP. Engine exports added:
`isImmobilized`, `DEFAULT_POISON_DAMAGE`, `StatusName`, `EffectStep`,
`deriveAttackEffect`; internal helpers `isLethallyDamaged` (owns the
hp-null-is-a-data-gap rule) and `activeTop` (the 8×-repeated active/uid/card
preamble).

**Surface (D21).** `CardModel.battle {damage, hp, conditions}` attached by the
projection; SLP/PAR/CNF/BRN/PSN chips (opposite corner from the damage chip;
PSN shows the amount when raised above `DEFAULT_POISON_DAMAGE`); HUD disables
attack+retreat via the engine's `isImmobilized` with a reason line, confusion
gets a note; log rows for all 8 events (shared `STATUS_LABELS`, UI-side);
checkup events ride INSIDE the attack/endTurn action's batch (TURN_ENDED →
ticks/flips → TURN_STARTED in one list — animations must key off post-batch
state, a recovery row can precede the same uid's KNOCKED_OUT). Projection
reports `activeSeat: null` during **between-turns** ko parks (discriminator:
the pending queue has drained the endTurn/checkup tail to bare startTurn);
GamePage's `?? waitingOn` fallback highlights the prize picker. Demo decks:
Numel sv03-031 ×3 (Fire, defender Burn), Luvdisc sv02-047 ×3 (Water, defender
Asleep); Slowpoke's Rest now actually simulates (self-Asleep + heal 30).

### Known gaps / traps for M4+
- **Paralysis has no applied-turn stamp**, so the blanket ended-seat clear is
  wrong for SELF-paralysis at your own turn's end (official wording: cleared
  only if "Paralyzed since the beginning of your last turn"). The deriver
  refuses self-`Paralyzed` (→ skip flag) to keep the wrong case unreachable;
  §12/§13.4 in the rules doc now carry the real conditional. M4 effects that
  self-paralyze need the stamp first.
- **The `EffectStep` interpreter is attack-private by design** (runs after
  damage, targets hardcoded to the two Actives). M4's registry goes ABOVE it
  (`programFor(cardId) ?? deriveAttackEffect(text)` at the one call site) and
  will need mid-effect decision parking, pre-damage `ModifyDamage`, and
  non-Active targets — expect to restructure the interpreter then, not
  extract it now (review adjudicated: premature today).
- **Classic prints are deliberately underivable** ("The Defending Pokémon is
  now …" — sv-era cards say "Your opponent's Active Pokémon"); they keep the
  loud skip flag. Adding the classic pattern is a one-line M4 candidate once
  someone checks the era's timing semantics match.
- ~~`knockOut`/checkup are **Active-only**; M4 bench damage (spread/snipes)
  must generalize the target and revisit the double-KO guard's two-KO framing.~~
  **Closed by M4 slice 4** (2026-07-18): `knockOut` takes a uid (Active or
  bench), the `collectKnockOuts` sweep scans full boards, and its §14 tie guard
  generalizes to "both seats lost a Pokémon" (the speculative-apply shape, as
  predicted).
- `BattleConditions` structurally restates `SpecialConditions` (playmat stays
  engine-free), pinned by a two-way assignability assert in `battleStateOf`.
  When M4 markers widen conditions, **lift the vocabulary to
  `@luminous/schema`** (the BASIC_ENERGY_TYPES precedent).
- Still open from M2: `prizeValueOf` = 1 (ingest suffix column), name-derived
  energy provision, phase↔`pending[0]` dual encoding (checkup added no
  parked-phase writers, so it stands unchanged), opponent-hand/setup reveal
  re-key (P4 opaque-alias design).

## M4 slice 1 as built (2026-07-17) — evolution

**Shape.** New `evolve` action (turn.ts, alongside playBasicToBench/retreat;
`EvolveAction {seat, uid, target: PokemonTarget}`). Places an Evolution card
from hand on the **stack top** of one of the actor's own in-play Pokémon
(Active or Bench). An Evolution card is `evolveFromOf(card) !== null`
(cards.ts — `card.category === "Pokemon" ? card.evolveFrom : null`; `stage`
is not consulted, `evolveFrom` is the ingested datum). Legality, in order:
turnGate → **first-turn ban** → hand/uid → NOT_AN_EVOLUTION → wire target →
resolve target → **EVOLVE_MISMATCH** (the evolution's `evolveFrom` must equal
the target top card's NAME, §10) → **EVOLVE_TOO_SOON**. Carry-over (§10):
damage, Energy, Tools STAY (they ride on the stack, untouched by the spread);
Special Conditions + markers are cleared; `turnPlayed` resets to `state.turn`.
Events: `POKEMON_EVOLVED {from, to, target}` + (iff the Active had conditions)
`STATUS_CLEARED reason:"evolved"` whose `uid` is the NEW top. No KO check —
evolving never KOs (HP only rises; §10 devolution, the one shrink, is
effect-only and out of scope). New error codes NOT_AN_EVOLUTION /
EVOLVE_MISMATCH / EVOLVE_TOO_SOON / FIRST_TURN_EVOLVE; new export
`evolveFromOf`; engineVersion 0.4.0.

**Timing is two checks, deliberately (§4/§10).** `turnPlayed >= state.turn`
covers "not the turn it came into play, nor twice in one turn" (a setup
Pokémon carries turnPlayed **0**, a benched/evolved one the turn it arrived).
That alone can't express "no evolve on your own FIRST turn" — a setup
Pokémon's 0 is < turn 1/2 — so a separate `state.turn === (seat ===
firstPlayer ? 1 : 2)` ban fires first (firstPlayer plays odd turns, so their
first turn is 1 and the other seat's is 2). This is the turn/firstPlayer check
`InPlayPokemon.turnPlayed`'s M1 comment always reserved.

**Surface (web).** No projection change — the projection already reads the
stack **top**, so an evolved Pokémon renders its new card with carried damage
(battle state) and cleared conditions automatically. Drag routing:
`moveToAction`/`gamePlacementPredicate` treat a Pokémon dropped ONTO an own
occupant as an evolve gesture — pokemon→Active and pokemon→**occupied** bench
index → `evolve`; pokemon→a **free** bench slot (the index-less frame
container) stays `playBasicToBench`. This is the SAME indexed-vs-container
disambiguation energy-attach uses (confirmed against the drop layer's
`parsePlacement`: occupied slots carry `data-card-index`, the bench frame
carries none). Fine legality stays the engine's → the error pill (D19,
lockstep property extended in placement.test.ts over a real turn-3 evolvable
board). `logFromEvents` rows for POKEMON_EVOLVED ("evolved X → Y") and the
"evolved" clear. Demo decks carry real lines
(Ember Fuecoco→Crocalor→Skeledirge, Tidal Buizel→Floatzel). Suite 892 → 914.

### Known gaps / traps for the rest of M4
- **Projection identity pops on evolve.** The CardModel id keys off the
  stack-top uid, so evolving swaps basic-uid → evolution-uid and the Pixi
  layer remounts (pop, not a morph) — same class as the hidden-back re-key.
  Animation-layer follow-up; damage/conditions are correct (battle state).
- **The interpreter/registry are still untouched** (evolution is a board
  action, no effect ops) — the D20 traps below stand for the next slices.
- **Rare Candy** (Basic → Stage 2 skip) is an Item, so it waits for the
  trainer registry; the `evolve` action only does adjacent-stage placement.
- `presentStatuses`/first-turn logic are evolve-local; if Abilities add their
  own "is it this seat's first turn" gate, lift a shared helper then.

## M4 slice 2 as built (2026-07-17) — Trainers + Abilities + the effect interpreter

**Shape (D23).** The M3 attack-private `runEffectSteps` is replaced by ONE
shared, resumable interpreter (`interpreter.ts`): `runProgram(state, ops, ctx,
events) → {kind:"done"|"parked"}`. `EffectStep` grew into `EffectOp` (effects.ts
— applyStatus/heal/coinFlipGate PLUS drawCards/discardHand/shuffleDeck/
searchDeck/switchActive/gust/healChosen); the deriver still emits the same ops.
The **id-keyed registry** (`registry.ts`, `programFor(cardId)`) sits above the
deriver at the one attack call site (`programFor(id)?.attack ?? derive(text)`)
and IS the only source for Trainer/Ability programs (no text deriver for those
— an unauthored card can't be played/used, loud not guessed).

**Mid-effect parking.** A decision op (search a deck, gust/switch/heal a chosen
Pokémon) PARKS: the interpreter returns `parked` with a prompt + a JSON
continuation (`{pendingOp, rest, ctx}`), and the new **`effect:choose` Phase**
stores it. `resolveEffect` validates the choice against the prompt (wire-safe —
every uid/ref checked), applies the awaited op, and resumes the rest.
Forced/empty decisions auto-resolve (searchDeck is "up to", so it parks whenever
≥1 candidate; a mandatory target auto-resolves at exactly one). NO effect in
scope KOs or ends the game, so the interpreter never touches the flow.ts tail —
a future damaging op wires its KO check through the shared `knockOut` there.

**New actions (cardplay.ts).** `playTrainer` (Item any number §7.1 / Supporter
one/turn §7.2 + the §4 first-turn Supporter ban; the card leaves hand →
discard up front, then the program runs — none references itself mid-effect;
`trainerPlayable` rejects gust/switch with no legal target BEFORE committing).
`useAbility` (activated only; §9 Active-only + the once-per-turn per-Pokémon
flag `${uid}:${ability}` in `TurnAllowances.abilitiesUsed`, reset each turn).
`resolveEffect` (the parked-decision resolver). New error codes
NOT_A_TRAINER / TRAINER_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED / TRAINER_NOT_SIMULATED /
SUPPORTER_ALREADY_PLAYED / FIRST_TURN_SUPPORTER / NO_LEGAL_TARGET /
NO_SUCH_ABILITY / ABILITY_ACTIVE_ONLY / ABILITY_ALREADY_USED /
BAD_EFFECT_CHOICE. New events TRAINER_PLAYED / ABILITY_USED / HAND_DISCARDED /
DECK_SEARCHED / POKEMON_SWITCHED / EFFECT_PENDING (+ DrawReason "effect",
DAMAGE_DEALT gained optional `reduction`).

**Passive abilities are a pipeline HOOK, not the interpreter.** Bouffalant
"Bouffer" (−20 damage AFTER Weakness/Resistance) is read in attack.ts's damage
step from `programFor(defenderCard.id)?.passive?.damageReductionAfterWR`, floored
at 0, surfaced as `DAMAGE_DEALT.reduction`. (Active-defender only for now —
bench damage generalizes with the KO-target work.)

**Surface (web).** Trainers/Abilities are HUD **buttons** in the TurnPanel
(GameHud) — NOT board drags (the drag layer's `moveToAction`/
`gamePlacementPredicate` already no-op on unknown phases, so `effect:choose`
affords nothing); button gating mirrors §4/§7.2/§9 but the ENGINE owns fine
legality (afford-then-reject pill for gust/switch preconditions, D19).
`effect:choose` renders a chooseCards (multi-select up to max, "Take none") or
choosePokemon dialog → `resolveEffect`. Projection maps the phase (activeSeat =
waitingSeat = controller; `pendingDecision.effectChoose` carries the prompt) and
its exhaustive switch caught the new phase at compile time. `logFromEvents` rows
for all six new events. `presentStatuses` lifted to types.ts (shared by
retreat/evolve/switch). Demo decks: both share the 6 Trainers, Tidal runs
Chien-Pao ex, Ember runs Bouffalant. Suite 914 → **948**.

**Representative set (real sv ids, verified live 2026-07-17):** Professor's
Research (sv01-189, draw 7), Nest Ball (sv01-181, search→bench), Boss's Orders
(sv02-172, gust), Switch (sv01-194), Potion (sv01-188, heal 30), Energy Search
(sv01-172, search→hand); Chien-Pao ex (sv02-061, *Shivery Chill* — search 2
Basic {W} Energy, activated once/turn Active-only), Bouffalant (sv03-174,
*Bouffer* — passive). Broad SV-pool coverage is a later Workflow fan-out that
just adds registry rows.

**Review (high effort, 8 angles) + fixes:** no correctness bugs shipped; two
findings fixed in-session — (a) `searchMove` removed all picked uids from the
deck but benched only `slice(0, room)` (guarded today by the prompt's max
clamp, but the removal/placement sets were computed independently — now
clamped to bench space BEFORE anything leaves the deck, the M1 card-safety
lesson), and (b) `presentStatuses` duplicated (turn.ts + interpreter.ts) →
lifted to types.ts. Deferred (noted): the `effect:choose` prompt carries the
search candidates (deck uids) unredacted in the projection — a P4-scoped
hidden-info gap, unobservable in hot-seat (the HUD gates on `acting`), same
class as the opponent-hand backs.

**Verification.** `bun run check` green (tsc + biome + **948 tests**), incl. 28
engine cardplay tests (every archetype + parking + forced auto-resolve +
wire-safety + purity) and 5 DOM integration tests driving the REAL GameHud →
engine → effect dialogs → resolveEffect. **Live browser (/play):** the game
boots clean with the new decks (full 60-card cardPool incl. all Trainers +
Chien-Pao + Bouffalant fetched from the live api, canvas renders, ZERO console
errors); setup drags work; the **TurnPanel renders the new Trainer buttons live
with correct §4/§7.2 gating** (Boss's Orders disabled on turn 1, enabled on p1's
turn 2; Switch enabled as an unbounded Item). All 8 new card ids resolve through
`GET /cards/:id` with the exact fields the engine reads. NOT driven to a fully
RESOLVED effect in-browser — the demo hands dealt lacked the preconditions
(opponent bench for gust, the right Item in hand) and the Pixi bench-drag
coordinate hit-test is the documented session-eater; the effect-resolution path
is exhaustively covered by the engine + DOM tests instead.

### Known gaps / traps for the rest of M4
- **Stadium + Tool** (persistent zones) are deferred: `playTrainer` rejects them
  (TRAINER_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED). Stadium needs a shared board zone + the continuous
  pipeline; Tool needs the attach + a continuous hook + KO-discard-with-tool
  (the `InPlayPokemon.tools` slot exists but nothing attaches yet).
- **Triggered abilities** (on-play / on-KO / between-turns) are deferred — they
  need trigger scan points at many call sites (bench-play, evolve, checkup, KO),
  a bigger surface best isolated. Only activated + passive shipped.
- **Rare Candy** (Basic → Stage 2 skip) waits for the item registry's
  hand-inspection + evolve reuse (its id sv01-191 is in the catalog).
- **The passive hook reads unconditionally** (no §9 ability-lock in scope). The
  defender-Active reduction (attack.ts §8.5) still is; M4 slice 4's `spreadDamage`
  now ALSO applies a *benched* Pokémon's own reduction passive/Tool (Bouffer −20
  reduces spread on the bench), via the same `passivesOf`. The attacker's
  Active-only bonus (Vitality Band) correctly does not reach the bench. Ability-lock
  still unscoped.
- **EffectContext is only `{seat}`** — an ability using a "self" op from the
  BENCH would wrongly target the Active. No in-scope ability does (Chien-Pao is
  Active-only); a bench-usable self-targeting ability needs the source uid in
  ctx.
- **P4 hidden info:** the `effect:choose` prompt (search candidates) and the
  existing opponent-hand/setup backs all need the P4 opaque-alias/redaction
  design — the projection is the same filter P4 will apply.
- Still open from earlier: `prizeValueOf` = 1 (ingest suffix — Chien-Pao ex
  currently gives 1 prize, not 2), name-derived energy provision, the
  projection-identity pop on evolve/switch (Pixi remount, animation follow-up).

## M4 slice 3 as built (2026-07-18) — persistent zones (Stadium + Tool)

**Shape (D24).** The persistent-zone Trainers are NOT interpreter programs —
their effects are **continuous**, so a new module
(`packages/engine/src/continuous.ts`) is the ONE place a rule read consults
them. It aggregates a Pokémon's printed passive (Bouffalant "Bouffer") WITH its
attached Tools, and the shared Stadium's effects, and exposes:
`effectiveRetreatCost` (turn.ts retreat — Beach Court's Basic −1),
`effectiveAttackCost` (attack.ts §8.2 — League HQ's Basic +{C}),
`effectiveMaxHp` (flow.ts `isLethallyDamaged` — the KO test — plus the web
`battle.hp`; Bravery Charm's Basic +50), and `passivesOf` (attack.ts §8.5: the
attacker's pre-W/R **bonus** (Vitality Band +10) and the defender's post-W/R
**reduction** — now Bouffer AND a defending Tool, summed). Pure and total: a
missing card/program/stadium contributes nothing.

**Stadium (§7.3).** A single shared `GameState.stadium` `{uid, owner}`.
`playTrainer` routes a Stadium to **`playStadium`**: one play per turn (a new
`TurnAllowances.stadiumPlayed`), replace-on-play discards the predecessor to
**its OWNER's** pile (`STADIUM_DISCARDED`, read off the post-hand-update state
so self-replace still works), and the same-**NAME** ban compares `card.name`
(the sv02-171/sv03-229 "Artazon" reprints can't self-replace). Allowed on turn
1 (§4 bans only Supporters + attacking). Stays in play; its effects are
continuous.

**Tool (§7.4).** A new action **`attachTool` {seat, uid, target}** (Tools carry
a target, so they do NOT go through playTrainer — routing a Tool there rejects
`TRAINER_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED`). One Tool per Pokémon (`TOOL_ALREADY_ATTACHED`),
uncapped per turn, consumes NO allowance, no detach — the `InPlayPokemon.tools`
slot M1 reserved is finally populated. It rides the stack through evolution
(the §10 spread preserves `tools`) and switch/gust (`switchInto` moves the whole
object) and discards with a KO'd stack (`discardFromStack "all"` already
included `tools`). New event `TOOL_ATTACHED`.

**Coverage.** A Stadium with no `stadium` row / a Tool with no `passive` row
reject **`TRAINER_NOT_SIMULATED`** (never a silent no-op). Representative set
(verified vs local D1 2026-07-18): Beach Court (sv01-167), Pokémon League
Headquarters (sv03-192), Vitality Band (sv01-197), Bravery Charm (sv02-173).
`DAMAGE_DEALT` gained an optional `bonus`; 4 new error codes (NOT_A_TOOL /
STADIUM_ALREADY_PLAYED / STADIUM_SAME_NAME / TOOL_ALREADY_ATTACHED). engine
0.5.0 → 0.6.0.

**Web.** Stadiums are BOTH a HUD button (TurnPanel, greyed by the §7.3
once-per-turn + same-name gates) AND a drag onto the shared stadium slot —
`moveToAction`/`gamePlacementPredicate` gained the one non-own drop target
(`owner:"global" zone:"stadium"`); Tools attach by drag onto an own Pokémon
(the energy-attach gesture, routed to `attachTool`). The projection renders the
shared Stadium public (it can't exist during setup), `battle.hp` reads the
continuous max HP (Bravery Charm shows live), and the HUD retreat cost / attack
payability read the effective ones. `logFromEvents` rows for TOOL_ATTACHED /
STADIUM_DISCARDED and a pre-W/R `· boosted +N` breadcrumb (ordered before
weakness so the §8.5 math reads correctly). Both demo decks stay 60 cards
(Ember: Beach Court + Vitality Band; Tidal: League HQ + Bravery Charm — DIFFERENT
per deck so the replace path is reachable live). Suite 948 → **974**.

**Review (2 Opus agents, rules+integration / wire-safety+web-lockstep) + fixes:**
wire-safety proven clean (33 hostile `attachTool`/`playStadium` inputs — zero
throws, zero mutation; every event payload a copy; continuous.ts total on real
states). Two findings: (a) the `· boosted` log breadcrumb printed AFTER weakness
though it applies before — reordered to pipeline order; (b) **the deferred
evolve-below-HP KO gap** — Bravery Charm is the one effect that can LOWER
effective max HP on evolution, so a damaged charmed Basic evolving below the new
stage's HP should KO the instant it evolves (§8.1), but `evolve` runs no KO
check and the engine's KO flow is Active-only + turn-ending. An Active in that
state is cleaned up at the next Checkup; a benched one is NOT (the same
Active-only KO limit bench spread damage carries). Deferred WITH the bench-KO
generalization (a mid-turn KO that resumes the actor's turn is new flow
machinery), documented at turn.ts/registry.ts and PINNED by a characterization
test so a future fix flips it deliberately. **→ Closed by slice 4 (below):
`evolve` runs the KO check through the new mid-turn KO flow, and the
characterization test now asserts the KO.**

**Verification.** `bun run check` green (tsc + biome + **974 tests** — 18 new
engine cardplay covering Stadium replace/same-name/one-per-turn, the four
continuous effects, Tool attach + carry-over + KO discard, wire-safety, purity;
plus new projection/log/placement-lockstep/HUD-DOM tests). **Live /play smoke
(agent-browser, seed frozen to 6, ZERO console errors):** DROVE the two new
gestures to resolution — **Beach Court dragged onto the shared stadium slot**
(board summary "Stadium: Beach Court", persisted through two turns + hot-seat
flips) which **dropped Growlithe's retreat button from "Retreat (2)" to
"Retreat (1)" live** (the continuous discount in the HUD), then **Vitality Band
dragged onto Growlithe** ("Growlithe (1 tool)", log row "attached Vitality Band
→ Growlithe"). The Stadium's shared zone, Tool attachment, projection, and the
continuous retreat read all confirmed end-to-end on the real Pixi board.

## M4 slice 4 as built (2026-07-18) — the Knock Out generalized off the Active

**Shape (D25).** The KO flow was **Active-only + turn-ending**; slice 4
generalizes it so bench spread/snipe damage and a mid-turn KO both work.

- **`knockOut(state, koedSeat, koedUid, prizeSeat, events)`** (flow.ts) now KOs
  ANY in-play Pokémon, found by its stack-top **uid**: a benched KO discards the
  whole stack, compacts the bench, seeds ONLY a `takePrizes` stage (no
  promotion — no empty Active spot); an Active KO is unchanged (takePrizes +
  promote). Addressing by uid (not index) makes a batch of KOs shift-safe.
- **`collectKnockOuts(state, seats, events)`** is the ONE post-damage sweep —
  every lethally-damaged in-play Pokémon (Active + Bench), prizes to each KO'd
  side's opponent (`otherSeat`, universal per §8.1), stages grouped
  **prizes-first**, and the §14 **tie guard runs only when both seats lost a
  Pokémon** (proven necessary + sufficient in review) via the same speculative
  `evaluateWin`. It replaced the inline KO blocks in `attack.ts finishAttack`
  (now sweeps the defender's WHOLE board) and `runCheckup`, so §14 precedence
  stays single-sourced.
- **A new `PendingStage {kind:"resumeTurn"; seat}` + `resolveMidTurnKnockOuts`**:
  a KO mid-turn (not from an attack) resolves its prize/promote stages then
  **RESUMES** the actor's turn (`advance` restores `turn:action`) instead of
  ending it — the new §8.1 flow shape. Allowances live on `GameState`, untouched.
  `seats` MUST be the boards the effect actually damaged (evolve passes
  `[actorSeat]`; a future opponent-damaging snipe passes that board).
- **evolve** now runs the KO check on the just-evolved Pokémon — closing D24's
  deferred **evolve-below-HP gap**: a benched charmed Basic that evolves below
  the new stage's HP (a Bravery Charm's Basic-only +50 dropping off — the one
  effect that LOWERS effective max HP) is Knocked Out the instant it evolves,
  mid-turn, the opponent taking the prize on the actor's turn. The
  characterization test now asserts the KO.
- **`spreadDamage` op** (`{op:"spreadDamage", target:"opponentBench", amount}`,
  effects.ts) placed by the interpreter — flat damage to EACH opponent Benched
  Pokémon; no Weakness/Resistance on the Bench (§8.5), but a benched Pokémon's
  own reduction passive/Tool (Bouffalant "Bouffer" −20) STILL applies (via
  `passivesOf`), while the attacker's Active-only bonus (Vitality Band) does
  not. The interpreter only PLACES the damage (one `DAMAGE_DEALT` per benched
  Pokémon) — the KO check stays in `finishAttack`, so the interpreter still
  never KOs or touches the flow tail. A sixth deriver sentence recognizes "This
  attack does N damage to each of your opponent's Benched Pokémon." (optional
  W/R clarifier).

**Web.** The ONLY source change is `projection.ts koParkActiveSeat` treating
`resumeTurn` as in-turn (a mid-turn KO park still reports the actor as
`activePlayer`, unlike a between-turns checkup park). The exhaustive
`phaseViewOf` Phase switch is untouched (`resumeTurn` is a PendingStage, not a
Phase); the log/HUD need nothing — `DAMAGE_DEALT`/`KNOCKED_OUT` resolve a benched
uid the same way, and the opponent's mid-turn prize pick rides the existing
`waitingOn` viewer-follow (the HUD gates on `waitingOn`, never turn ownership).
Representative demonstrator is a fixture spread attacker (`fix-sniper`, Spread
Shot [C] 30 + 20 to each opponent Benched); a live sv card lands with the
coverage fan-out. engineVersion 0.6.0 → 0.7.0.

**Review (2 Opus agents — rules+flow / wire-safety+web-lockstep): both clean, no
correctness defects.** The rules agent PROVED the §14 tie guard's `bothSeatsHit`
condition necessary AND sufficient (a one-sided KO batch can only ever win for
the one player who gains prizes / faces the emptied board), verified prize
attribution for every KO source, the uid-addressed multi-KO shift-safety,
game-over-beats-resume precedence, evolve's no-spurious-firing, and the spread
math. The wire agent proved koParkActiveSeat correct in all three park origins,
`phaseViewOf` correctly unchanged, the opponent's mid-turn prize pick flips the
device correctly (nothing gates on turn ownership), and spreadDamage's event
contract + purity. Two INFORMATIONAL notes (not defects): `spreadDamage` treats
reduction passives as position-agnostic (correct for the pool — a future
Active-only reduction passive would want an `activeOnly` gate), and
`finishAttack`'s `batch.done` branch is a deliberate defensive dead branch until
a both-sides-damaging attack lands.

**Verification.** `bun run check` green (tsc + biome + **983 tests** — 974 → 983:
8 new engine cardplay in `knockout.test.ts` (spread derive, flat spread + no
bench weakness, benched reduction still applies, single bench KO no-promotion,
double Active+Bench KO prizes-first drive-out, §14.1 win off a bench KO, empty
bench no-op, purity) + a projection test for the mid-turn KO park; the flipped
evolve-below-HP characterization test in `stadiumTool.test.ts`). **Live /play
smoke (agent-browser, seed 6, ZERO console errors):** the game boots with the
re-ingested demo decks — Pixi canvas renders, all cardPool fetches succeed
(no 4xx/5xx), and the coin-toss action drives engine → projection → HUD with an
empty error collector. The new mechanics themselves are NOT demo-reachable (no
spread card in the decks; the evolve-below-HP window needs a contrived board),
so they are covered exhaustively by the engine + web tests + the two clean
reviews — the slice-2 precedent for a mechanic whose live preconditions the demo
hands don't deal.

## M4 slice 5 as built (2026-07-18) — Special Energy (§6.1)

**Shape (D26).** Special Energies provisioned a conservative 1 Colorless
(name-derived); slice 5 models their rules text as data.

- **`EnergyProgram`** on `CardProgram.energy` (registry.ts): `{ provides:
  string[]; demoteWithOtherSpecial?: string[]; onAttach?: {kind:
  "switchIfBenched"} }`. `provides` units may be a concrete type, the
  **`ANY_ENERGY` wildcard** (cards.ts — "any 1 type"), or several (multi-unit).
- **`providedEnergy(state, pokemon)`** (continuous.ts) is the ONE provision read
  site: a basic energy gives its type; an authored special energy its
  EnergyProgram units, evaluating Luminous's "demote to {C} if the holder has
  any OTHER Special Energy attached" (two Luminous each see the other → BOTH
  demote); an unauthored special energy falls back to one Colorless (graceful —
  an energy always provides something, unlike an unsimulated Trainer's loud
  reject). Pure, total, order-stable.
- **`costMet`** (attack.ts) upgraded for the wildcard: `ANY_ENERGY` fills a typed
  shortfall OR a Colorless slot — wildcards allocated to the (pickier) typed
  needs first, then every remaining unit pays Colorless. Provably optimal
  (Hall's theorem) and backward-compatible with all-concrete provision;
  brute-forced in review against a bipartite matcher (13,640 cases, 0
  mismatches).
- **On-attach**: `attachEnergy` (turn.ts) runs `energy.onAttach` — Jet Energy's
  `switchIfBenched` switches a benched holder to the Active Spot (reusing
  `switchInto`, now exported from interpreter.ts), firing ENERGY_ATTACHED then
  POKEMON_SWITCHED; nothing fires on an Active attach.

**Web.** The engine's §8.2 cost check AND the HUD's payability preview both call
`providedEnergy` — **the D18 duplicated payability is gone** (proven byte-for-byte
in review). The log's ENERGY_ATTACHED row resolves its host by the energy's
**uid**, not the target slot, so Jet's mid-batch bench compaction can't misname
it. Demo decks run the two energies **different per deck** (Ember: Jet ×3,
Tidal: Luminous ×3 — type-neutral, so the disjoint-energy rule keeps them
split); both reachable in one Ember-vs-Tidal game. engineVersion 0.7.0 → 0.8.0.

**Representative set:** Jet Energy (sv02-190) + Luminous Energy (sv02-191),
verified vs local D1. The SV-era catalog has **no Double Turbo** (swsh-era), so
the multi-provide case here is the wildcard kind; `provides` being an array still
supports a future multi-unit-same-type energy as a one-row registry add (proven
by the `costMet(["Colorless","Colorless"], ["Colorless","Colorless"])` test).

**Review (2 Opus agents — rules+matcher / wire+web).** Rules agent: **no
defects**, brute-force-verified the matcher, confirmed provision / the Luminous
demote (incl. two-Luminous) / the Jet switch / the League HQ-surcharge
interaction; suggested coverage pins (added). Wire agent: **one MEDIUM** — Jet's
on-attach switch compacts the bench, so the ENERGY_ATTACHED **log row** (which
resolved the host by index against the settled state) named the wrong Pokémon;
**fixed** (resolve by uid) + regression-pinned in logFromEvents.test.ts. Plus a
LOW stale-JSDoc (per-deck basic-energy counts) and a stale comment — both fixed.
Everything else proven clean (attachEnergy never-throw, switchInto pure,
providedEnergy pure, HUD lockstep).

**Verification.** `bun run check` green (tsc + biome + **1002 tests** — 983 →
1002: 16 engine cardplay in specialEnergy.test.ts (wildcard costMet incl.
multi-wildcard + multi-unit + backward-compat, provision as data, the Luminous
demote incl. two-Luminous + unauthored-special, Jet's bench switch vs Active
no-switch, a real typed attack paid by a wildcard, purity) + 2 HUD-DOM payability
tests (a Luminous wildcard enables a typed attack, a demoted Luminous disables
it) + a log host regression test). **Live /play smoke (agent-browser, seed 6,
ZERO console errors):** boots with the re-ingested demo decks — Pixi canvas
renders and BOTH special energies (sv02-190 Jet, sv02-191 Luminous) fetch 200
from the api (the cardPool resolves them). Driving the attach gestures to
resolution live is the documented Pixi hit-test session-eater, so the mechanics
are covered by the engine + HUD-DOM + log tests + the two reviews.

## M4 slice 6 as built (2026-07-18) — triggered Abilities (§9)

**Shape (D27).** Triggered Abilities — the ones that FIRE on a game event rather
than being player-activated (§9) — get a **`TriggeredAbility`** entry on
`CardProgram.triggered` (`{ name; trigger; program; optional?; activeOnly? }`,
registry.ts) run through the shared interpreter by a small new module
**`triggers.ts`**, wired at THREE scan points:

- **`onPlayToBench`** — turn.ts `playBasicToBench`, on the freshly-benched
  Pokémon (the last dense slot). A *turn* play only — a setup placement
  (setupPlaceBench) is a different handler and not "during your turn", so it
  never triggers.
- **`onEvolve`** — turn.ts `evolve`, on the just-evolved Pokémon (at
  `action.target`), AFTER the evolve-below-HP KO check (a Pokémon KO'd on
  evolution left play, so its own "when you evolve" Ability does not fire).
- **`betweenTurns`** — flow.ts `runCheckup`, over every in-play Pokémon in
  `[endedSeat, other]` order (Active then Bench), AFTER the §13 condition ticks
  and BEFORE the KO sweep.

**Parking vs synchronous.** Board triggers (onPlayToBench/onEvolve) run during
the controller's own turn, so a program needing a decision **PARKS on the
existing `effect:choose` phase** (triggers.ts `settleTrigger` ≡ cardplay.ts
`settleRun`) and resumes to turn:action via the same **`resolveEffect`** action
— a parked trigger is byte-identical to a parked Trainer. `betweenTurns` triggers
are **NON-PARKING by construction** (a heal-each / a fixed counter placement) and
thread synchronously through the one Checkup reduction; a placed counter
(Trevenant) that goes lethal is Knocked Out by the Checkup's own shared
`collectKnockOuts` sweep (and a lethal-poison-vs-lethal-counter double KO rides
its existing §14 tie guard). Representative cards carry ONE triggered Ability per
timing, so `runBoardTrigger` runs at most one program (chaining several parking
triggers on one card is a follow-up).

**Optional ("you may") triggers AUTO-FIRE** — every representative is pure upside
(search / heal / counter), and where the underlying op is "up to" (Insta-Flock's
search) the player can still take none. A yes/no confirm for a *downside* trigger
is the follow-up.

**New ops (effects.ts/interpreter.ts).** `healEach` (heal N from EACH of the
controller's own in-play Pokémon, one HEALED each, clamped); `damageActive` (PUT
N damage counters on the opponent's Active). `damageActive` is a **counter
placement, not attack damage** → no Weakness/Resistance AND **no
damage-reduction passive**: Bouffalant's "Bouffer" reduces *"damage from
attacks"*, which an Ability's counter is not (the same rule the poison/burn
Checkup ticks follow) — distinct from `spreadDamage`, which IS an attack's damage
and does take Bouffer. `healChosen.amount` widened to `number | "all"` (Arboliva
heals all, Potion still 30); a `byName` search filter (Insta-Flock searches its
own copies). New event `ABILITY_TRIGGERED`; `COUNTERS_PLACED` gained source
`"ability"`. engineVersion 0.8.0 → 0.9.0.

**Web.** The parked trigger reuses everything: the projection maps effect:choose
(controller = waitingSeat, so the hot-seat viewer stays put), `EffectChooseDialog`
mounts off the projected pending decision **origin-agnostically** (a bench-play/
evolve *drag* park renders the same chooseCards/choosePokemon dialog a Trainer
button does), and `resolveEffect` resolves it — **no new dialog, no projection
change**. Only `logFromEvents` grew: an `ABILITY_TRIGGERED` row and a
COUNTERS_PLACED `"ability"` (system) row.

**Representative set (real sv01–03 ids, verified vs local D1 2026-07-18):**
Flamigo "Insta-Flock" (sv02-170/227 — onPlayToBench, search up to 3 Flamigo →
hand), Arboliva "Enriching Oil" (sv01-023 — onEvolve, heal all from 1 of yours),
Garganacl "Blessed Salt" (sv02-123 — betweenTurns, heal 20 from each of yours),
Trevenant "Forest Miasma" (sv03-012 — betweenTurns, Active-only, 1 counter on the
opp's Active). NOT added to the seed-tuned demo decks (an auto-firing trigger
would perturb the demo hands) — covered by engine + web tests, the slice-4/5
precedent.

**Review (2 Opus agents — rules+flow / wire+web).** Both agents were terminated
early by the shared usage limit (reset pending), so the review is PARTIAL. Before
dying the rules agent CONFIRMED one bug: `damageActive` was applying the
defender's `damageReductionAfterWR`, so Trevenant's counter on a Bouffalant
(Bouffer −20) reduced 10 → 0 and placed nothing — **fixed** (counters are not
attack damage; placed flat) + regression-pinned (`sv03-174` in TRIGGER_DECK). The
remaining risk areas were self-verified: the turn-gate makes `settleTrigger`'s
done→turn:action always correct; the §14 double-KO path is the shared
`collectKnockOuts` (unchanged, already tested for the checkup double-KO); the web
lockstep holds (viewer-follow + origin-agnostic dialog, confirmed by reading
useLocalGame/GameHud). A `/code-review` re-run after the limit resets is the
logged follow-up.

**Deferred (documented, not silent):** `onKnockOut` triggers (fire during the
OPPONENT's turn mid-KO-sweep — need a resume-the-tail continuation, the hairiest
timing); parking mid-Checkup (a betweenTurns Ability needing a decision); the
multi-target **snipe** (Hawlucha "Flying Entry" choose-2 / Meowscarada "Bouquet
Magic" choose-1) + the `settleRun`→`resolveMidTurnKnockOuts` reuse — an
on-play/on-evolve *damaging* trigger that KOs mid-turn (needs a multi-Pokémon
prompt + settleRun sweeping the board after a damaging program). These land with
Rare Candy and the coverage fan-out.

**Verification.** `bun run check` green (tsc + biome + **1019 tests** — 1002 →
1019: 16 engine `triggered.test.ts` covering each scan point + parking + forced
auto-resolve + the setup-doesn't-trigger scoping + the Bouffer-counter regression
+ purity, plus 1 `logFromEvents` row test). No live /play smoke driven this
session (the representatives aren't in the demo decks and the review's browser
pass was cut by the usage limit); the mechanic is covered by the engine + web
tests and the confirmed fix. Files: effects.ts, events.ts, registry.ts,
interpreter.ts, triggers.ts (new), turn.ts, flow.ts, index.ts, testFixtures.ts,

## M4 slice 7 as built (2026-07-18) — Rare Candy (§7.1)

**Shape (D28).** Rare Candy evolves a Basic straight to a **Stage 2** from hand,
skipping the Stage 1 ("counts as evolving"). Because it evolves — and flow.ts
owns every Knock Out (the interpreter never KOs) — it is NOT an interpreter op
program but a dedicated **`rareCandy` action** (cardplay.ts)
`{seat, uid (the Rare Candy Item), target (the Basic), evolutionUid (the Stage
2)}`. The `evolve` tail was extracted into a shared **`placeEvolution`**
(turn.ts) that BOTH `evolve` and `rareCandy` call, so Rare Candy inherits §10
carry-over (damage/energy/tools stay, conditions/markers clear, turnPlayed
resets), the **on-evolve triggered Ability**, and the **evolve-below-HP mid-turn
KO** (a Bravery Charm's Basic-only +50 falling off) with zero new flow code. The
refactor is behavior-equivalent to the old `evolve` (proven in review + the
unchanged evolution suite). Timing mirrors `evolve` exactly (§4 first-turn ban +
`turnPlayed >= state.turn` "played this turn" ban → `FIRST_TURN_EVOLVE` /
`EVOLVE_TOO_SOON`); the target must be a Basic in play (`NOT_A_BASIC_POKEMON`).

**The Basic→Stage 2 bridge.** The catalog stores only each card's IMMEDIATE
`evolveFrom` (a Stage 2 names its Stage 1, never the Basic), so
`stage2EvolvesFromBasic` (cardplay.ts) resolves the link by BRIDGING: it checks
that some card in `state.cardPool` is a **Stage 1** named `stage2.evolveFrom`
whose own `evolveFrom` is the target Basic's name. **Documented gap:** a deck
running Rare Candy + a Stage 2 but ZERO copies of the intervening Stage 1 can't
resolve the link (the Stage 1 is absent from the pool) — the same ingest-debt
class as `prizeValueOf` = 1 and name-derived energy; the fix is a persisted
evolution family at ingest. The demo Ember deck runs Crocalor, so it resolves —
**verified vs the live api**: sv01-038 Skeledirge (Stage2, evolveFrom Crocalor) →
sv01-037 Crocalor (Stage1, evolveFrom Fuecoco) → sv01-036 Fuecoco (Basic).

**Registry + routing.** A **marker** `CardProgram.rareCandy?: true` (not a
program) identifies Rare Candy (sv01-191/256); `playTrainer` on a Rare Candy uid
rejects `TRAINER_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED` (the Tool-routing precedent). New error code
`RARE_CANDY_NO_STAGE2`. No new event — Rare Candy emits `TRAINER_PLAYED` (Item)
then `POKEMON_EVOLVED`, both already logged.

**Web.** An engine helper **`rareCandyOptions(state, seat)`** (the authority)
lists the legal `{target Basic, matching Stage 2 uids}` pairings (mirroring the
handler's Basic / turnPlayed / chain / first-turn checks). Rare Candy shows in
the Trainers list but its button opens a bespoke **`RareCandyDialog`** (pick a
Basic → pick a Stage 2 → dispatch `rareCandy`) rather than `playTrainer` — the
one Trainer that carries a target isn't expressible through the generic button;
it has a Cancel affordance (Rare Candy is optional) and a Back step when >1
Basic. `playableTrainers` greys the button out when `rareCandyOptions` is empty
(computed lazily — its cardPool scan only runs when a Rare Candy is in hand). The
**projection needs NO change**: `placeEvolution` resolves to `turn:action`
(done), a mid-turn KO park (`resumeTurn`, already in-turn per koParkActiveSeat),
or an on-evolve trigger park (`effect:choose`, origin-agnostic) — all already
handled. Demo: Rare Candy ×2 added to Ember (Fire energy 14→12; non-Basic for
non-Basic keeps the Basic count / mulligan rate). engineVersion 0.9.0 (unchanged
— additive). Suite 1019 → **1045**.

**Review (2 Opus agents — rules+engine / web+integration): both clean, no
correctness bugs.** The rules agent PROVED the `placeEvolution` refactor
byte-for-byte equivalent to the old `evolve` (state shape, event order,
hand-removal timing, the from/target split), the bridge sound (no realistic
false positive — the intermediate is forced to be a Stage 1), wire-safety
airtight (every index/uid/target checked; no throw or card-destruction), and
purity. The web agent confirmed the projection "no change" claim across all three
`placeEvolution` outcomes, the dialog/`rareCandyOptions` lockstep (an enabled
button can only ever produce a legal dispatch or a clean reject), the demo deck
(exactly 60, disjoint-except-shared-trainers intact, bridge present), and the log
rows. Fixes applied from the LOW findings: a **Cancel** button on the dialog
(optional play), `rareCandyOptions` made **lazy** in playableTrainers (perf), and
three coverage tests added (benched mid-turn KO, Tool carry-over, an Energy as
the evolution card). The documented bridge gap and the un-exercised sv01-256
reprint id are noted, not defects.

**Verification.** `bun run check` green (tsc + biome + **1045 tests** — 1019 →
1045: 24 engine `rareCandy.test.ts` covering the skip (Active + bench),
carry-over incl. Tools, both mid-turn KO paths, timing, the Basic/chain/Stage-2
rejections, the playTrainer reject, `rareCandyOptions`, wire-safety, purity + 2
DOM tests driving the real GameHud → RareCandyDialog → `rareCandy`). Production
`vite build` green. **Live /play boot smoke (agent-browser, seed 6, ZERO console
errors):** the game boots with the re-balanced Ember deck — Pixi canvas renders,
**all 75 cardPool fetches succeed (incl. sv01-191 Rare Candy → 200)**, the coin
toss advances into a clean 7-card deal (no mulligan storm from the energy swap),
and the live api confirms the real-catalog bridge resolves. Driving Rare Candy to
a live resolution needs a contrived seed + the Pixi hit-test session-eater, so it
is covered by the engine + DOM tests + the two clean reviews (the slice-4/5/6
precedent). Files: actions.ts, registry.ts, turn.ts (placeEvolution), cardplay.ts
(rareCandy + bridge + rareCandyOptions), index.ts, testFixtures.ts,
rareCandy.test.ts (new) + GameHud.tsx, demoDecks.ts/.test.ts,
GameHud.cardplay.dom.test.tsx.

## Notes for effect authoring at scale
Authoring handlers for many cards is a natural **Workflow** fan-out (one agent per
set/card batch, each verified against the rules doc). Ask the user before
launching one. The mechanics all live in `interpreter.ts` (op programs incl.
spreadDamage), `continuous.ts` (persistent-zone modifiers + special-energy
provision), `triggers.ts` (triggered-Ability scan points) and `registry.ts`
(EnergyProgram, StadiumEffects, PassiveEffects, TriggeredAbility, op programs),
and the KO flow reaches the whole board, so a new card in a known family is a few
lines of data in `registry.ts` — the fan-out adds rows, not code.
