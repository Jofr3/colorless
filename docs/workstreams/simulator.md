# Workstream: Simulator Engine (Phase 3)

Goal: replicate a real game of the Pokémon TCG well enough to play — first
approximately, then more accurately each pass. Reused by online matches (P4).

**Depends on:** P2 (real, usable decks) and `reference/ptcg-rules.md`.

## Approach
1. **Rules first.** `reference/ptcg-rules.md` (researched by a sub-agent) is the
   spec: setup, turn structure, zones, status conditions, KO/prizes, win
   conditions, first-turn restrictions, weakness/resistance math.
2. **Deterministic core.** A pure, seedable state machine:
   `GameState → Action → GameState` (+ emitted events for the UI/log). No
   randomness except a **seeded RNG** (shuffle, coin flips) so games are
   replayable and testable.
3. **Composable, data-driven card effects.** Most cards are minor variations on a
   few archetypes, so effects are authored as **data** — parameterized primitive
   ops over shared templates, not one function per card — and every op emits a
   semantic **event** the UI animates. Full design in the next section.
4. **State shape** builds on the existing playmat types
   (`src/features/playmat/types.ts`: BoardState, PlayerBoard, CardModel, zones)
   and the canonical `Card` (D5).

## Card-effect system — composable & data-driven

Most cards are minor variations on a **small set of effect archetypes**, so the
engine models effects as **composable primitives authored as data**, not a
bespoke function per card. Four layers:

1. **Primitive ops (`EffectOp`)** — the engine's instruction set: `Damage`,
   `ModifyDamage`, `PlaceDamageCounters`, `Heal`, `HealStatus`, `ApplyStatus`,
   `DrawCards`, `SearchDeck`, `Shuffle`, `AttachEnergy`, `DiscardEnergy`,
   `MoveCard`, `Switch`, `CoinFlip`, `ForEach`, `Conditional`, … Each op is a
   pure `(GameState, Ctx) → GameState` **and emits a semantic event** (below).
2. **Selectors & filters** — declarative targets (`self`, `opponentActive`,
   `yourBench`, `allYourPokemonMatching(filter)`, `playerChooses(filter)`) and
   card predicates (category / type / stage / isBasic / nameTag / energyCount…).
   Parameters, not code.
3. **Card effects as programs** — an attack is
   `{ cost, baseDamage, ops: EffectOp[] }`; an ability is
   `{ trigger, timing, oncePerTurn?, ops }`; a trainer / special energy is
   `{ provides?, ops }`. The whole effect is a small **data tree**.
4. **Archetype templates** — named builders for the common shapes, so a new card
   in a known family is one line of params:
   - `ballSearch({ cost, filter, dest })` → Nest / Great / Ultra / Quick / Level Ball
   - `handRefresh({ mode })` → Iono / Judge / Marnie / N
   - `gust()` → Boss's Orders-likes · `coinFlipDamage({ base, perHeads, flips })`
   - `energyAccelFromDiscard({ filter, target })`, …

### Grounded in real tcgdex data (fetched live)

| Card | tcgdex `effect` | Op program |
|---|---|---|
| Nest Ball | "Search your deck for a Basic Pokémon, put it on your Bench, shuffle." | `SearchDeck(filter=BasicPokémon, dest=Bench)` → `Shuffle` — the shared **ball** archetype |
| Gardevoir ex · *Psychic Embrace* | "…attach a Basic {P} Energy from discard to 1 of your {P} Pokémon… put 2 damage counters on it…" | ability: `AttachEnergy(from=Discard, filter=BasicP, target=chooseYourP)` → `PlaceDamageCounters(sameTarget, 2)`, guarded `notIfWouldKO` |
| Pikachu ex · *Thunderbolt* | "Discard all Energy from this Pokémon." | attack `baseDamage:150` → `DiscardEnergy(self, all)` |
| Iono's Voltorb · *Voltaic Chain* | damage `"20+"`: "+20 for each {L} Energy on all your Iono's Pokémon." | attack `baseDamage:20` → `ModifyDamage(+20 × count(energy=L, on=allYour(nameTag="Iono's")))` |
| Jet Energy | "provides {C}… when attached to a Benched Pokémon, switch it to Active." | special energy `provides:[C]`, onAttach: `Switch(attached → Active)` |

Notes:
- The **`damage` field encodes an op**: numeric = `baseDamage`; the `+` / `×` /
  `?` markers (`"20+"`) mean the attack also carries a `ModifyDamage` or
  `CoinFlip` op.
- The raw `effect` / `ability.effect` text is stored at ingest and is the
  **source a human or an LLM reads to author the op program** — tcgdex does not
  provide the program itself. (Ingest must persist `abilities` text too — add an
  `abilities_json` column to the `cards` table in `backend-data.md`.)

### Coverage strategy
Op programs are keyed by card id. A **structured fallback** derives what's purely
mechanical from the data alone (cost, base damage, weakness / resistance,
retreat, plain energy provision), so an un-authored card stays **playable** with
its text-effect flagged "not simulated" rather than guessed. Authoring programs
across the pool is a natural **Workflow** fan-out (batch by set; an LLM drafts
the op program from the effect text, each verified against
`reference/ptcg-rules.md`).

### Events → animation (built in, not bolted on)
The reducer returns `(GameState, GameEvent[])`. Every primitive emits
**semantic, serializable events** — `DAMAGE`, `ENERGY_ATTACHED`, `CARDS_DRAWN`,
`SEARCH`, `COIN_FLIP`, `SWITCH`, `STATUS_APPLIED`, `DAMAGE_COUNTERS_PLACED`,
`KNOCKOUT`, `PRIZE_TAKEN`, … The engine stays pure and knows nothing about
rendering.

- **Web:** an `animation[eventType]` registry maps each event to a playmat
  animation (the existing Pixi / GSAP layer). Adding or changing an animation is
  a registry entry — **no engine change**.
- **Online (P4):** the DO broadcasts the same event stream (hidden-info-filtered
  per player); clients animate identically. Local and online share one pipeline.

This is why the composable model pays off twice: it makes **authoring** cards
cheap (params over templates) and makes **animation** a pure consumer of the
event stream.

---

## Testing
- Unit tests per rule (KO → take prize, weakness ×2, status timing, deck-out
  loss…) and **scripted end-to-end games** with a fixed seed.
- The action/event log doubles as test fixtures and as the online wire format.

## Milestones
1. ✅ **Core state machine** — setup, turn phases, draw, energy attach, retreat,
   pass. Built + reviewed 2026-07-14 (commit `d34146c`); as-built notes below.
2. ✅ **Attacks** — costs, damage, weakness/resistance, KO + prize-taking, win
   check. Built + xhigh-reviewed + fixed 2026-07-16; as-built notes below. The
   **engine → playmat projection** (D17, `src/features/game/projection.ts`)
   landed alongside it. **Wire-up done 2026-07-17:** the projection drives a
   playable local hot-seat game at `/play` ("Wire-up as built" below).
3. ✅ **Status conditions + Pokémon Checkup** — built + reviewed (8 finders /
   7 verifiers, 10 reported findings all fixed) 2026-07-17; as-built notes
   below. Includes the first sliver of the effect system: the **text-derived
   status deriver** (D20).
4. 🚧 **Evolution done** (2026-07-17; as-built below). Abilities + the
   trainer/energy effect registry are the remaining M4 slices.
5. Coverage-expansion pass(es) across the SV-era pool; track % simulated.
6. Harden for authoritative server use (P4): validation, hidden info, server-owned
   RNG seed.

---

## M1 as built (`packages/engine`, 2026-07-14)

**Shape.** `createGame({seed, decks, cardPool})` → `{ok, state, events}`;
`applyAction(state, action)` → `{ok:true, state, events} | {ok:false, error}`.
Pure, JSON-safe `GameState` (mulberry32 `rngState` lives *in* it), no classes,
no wall clock. Illegal actions never throw and never mutate — the P4
authoritative server rests on that. Modules: `rng · types · events · actions ·
cards · setup · turn · index` (+ `testFixtures`). 60 tests.

**Locked design (D14).** Seats `p1|p2` are labels, not turn order (the coin
winner *chooses* via an action; `firstPlayer` records it). Every physical card
gets a uid (`"p1#0"`); zones hold uids; `cardIdByUid` + `cardPool` resolve them.
Choices are actions; anything with no choice (mulligan redraws, prize setting,
the turn-start draw) auto-resolves inside the reducer. `Phase` is the
discriminant every action validates against.

**Wire-safety rule (learned the hard way).** TypeScript types are *not* input
validation: P4 decodes actions from a client, so anything the engine reads off
an action must be checked at runtime. The review found three live bugs of
exactly this shape — a string `"1"` bench index passed `bench[index]` (string
key!) but failed `i === index`, destroying the energy card; retreat's
`slice(index + 1)` string-concatenated to `slice("11")` and deleted benched
Pokémon; and an unvalidated `first` seat crashed several actions later inside
`startTurn`. **Every new M2+ action must runtime-check its indices, seats and
counts** (`isBenchIndex`, the `isSeat` guard in `applyAction`).

**Event contract.** Events are values handed to consumers (animator, P4
broadcast, persisted log): payload arrays are always **copies**, never the
state's own arrays or the caller's action arrays. Every state change emits an
event — including a phase advance with no other effect (`COMPENSATION_DECIDED`
fires even when the player declines, or an event-only client hangs on the
prompt).

### Known gaps / traps for M2+
- **The turn tail is fused.** `endTurn` does TURN_ENDED → `runCheckup` (an M3
  no-op stub) → `startTurn(other)` in one reduction, and `runCheckup` is
  `GameState → GameState` so it **cannot pause**. M2's KO resolution needs to
  stop mid-sequence for decisions (which prize, which Pokémon to promote), and
  M2's attack ends the turn through the same tail. Expect to restructure this
  into a resumable/staged transition rather than fill in the stub.
- **Per-turn allowances live on the `turn:action` phase object** ("replacing the
  phase IS the reset"). Any mid-turn *interrupt* phase (targeting, prize pick,
  search) destroys them. When M2 adds interrupts, lift the allowances to a
  per-turn struct on `GameState` — where the supporter/stadium flags and the
  per-Pokémon once-per-turn ability flags (§15.J) belong anyway.
- **`gameOver.winner` is `Seat`** — §14 wants a `TIE`/`SUDDEN_DEATH` outcome
  surfaced, not silently picked. Widen when M2 lands simultaneous KOs. Nothing
  consumes the union yet, so it is still free to change.
- **Retreat's energy-discard is hand-rolled.** M2's KO (whole stack + energy +
  tools → discard) and the `DiscardEnergy` effect op need the same move — lift a
  shared "attached cards → discard" primitive rather than a third copy.
- **`retreatCostOf` maps `null` → 0 (free retreat).** In the real catalog `null`
  is a *data gap*, not a printed 0 (ingest writes null when tcgdex omits it), so
  a bad row silently becomes a free-retreat Pokémon. Fix belongs at ingest.
- **`drawToHand` short-draws silently** when the deck is shallower than `count`.
  M1's callers are safe (compensation is clamped so a player can never draw below
  their 6 prizes), but M2 draw effects (Professor's Research…) must not assume.
- **`resolveMulligans` has no iteration cap** — a legal 1-Basic deck loops until
  it draws the Basic (expected ~9 rounds, exponential tail). Accepted: capping it
  has no legal resolution.
- **No `SETUP_REVEALED` payload, and no stadium / Lost Zone zones yet.** The
  first matters for P4's hidden-info filter (the face-down placements are exactly
  what gets redacted, and the reveal must say what became public); the second
  lands with M4's trainers.
- **No engine → playmat projection exists.** `GameState` (uids + pool
  indirection) is deliberately not the playmat's `BoardState` (`CardModel[]`).
  The web app cannot render a game until that adapter is written — it is the
  natural next slice alongside M2.
- **`isBasicPokemon` now exists twice** in the repo: the engine's (over the
  canonical `Card.stage`) and the builder's (over `BuilderCard.subtype`, a
  relabelled view). They read different vocabularies of the same data and can
  drift. Lift one predicate into `@luminous/schema` when convenient.

## M2 as built (2026-07-16) — attacks, KO/prizes, win check + the projection

**Shape (D16).** The fused turn tail is gone: `GameState.pending` is a
`PendingStage[]` queue drained by `advance()` in the new `flow.ts`. Decision
stages **park** (phase becomes `ko:takePrizes`/`ko:promote`, prompt event
fires) or **auto-resolve** when forced; `attack` seeds its KO stages ahead of
the shared `turnTail(seat)` triple; `resolvePrizesAndResume`/
`resolvePromotionAndResume` own the resolve → pop → **win-check** → resume
sequence for BOTH the action handlers and advance's auto-resolves (the §14
check runs in exactly one place). Per-turn allowances live on
`GameState.allowances` (M4's supporter/stadium flags go there). `gameOver`
carries `GameOutcome` (win/tie). New actions `attack`/`takePrizes`/`promote`;
new events ATTACK_DECLARED, ATTACK_EFFECT_SKIPPED (the "not simulated" flag),
DAMAGE_DEALT (with `DamageModifier` breakdown), KNOCKED_OUT, PRIZES_OWED/
PRIZES_TAKEN, PROMOTION_REQUIRED/POKEMON_PROMOTED. The **projection** (D17)
maps `GameState` → playmat `BoardState` per viewer: `activePlayer` (turn
owner) vs `waitingOn` (who must act) are separate fields — during
`ko:promote` they differ, and a HUD gating on turn ownership alone soft-locks.

**M1 traps closed by M2:** the fused tail (staged queue), phase-object
allowances (lifted to state), `gameOver.winner` (widened to `GameOutcome`),
the hand-rolled retreat discard (shared `discardFromStack`, which returns the
moved uids in **pile order** — events must report that order, it's the §2
contract KNOCKED_OUT/RETREATED both follow now).

**The xhigh review paid again** (10 finder angles + 9 verifiers + sweep; 15
findings, all confirmed ones fixed in-session). The headline classes:
- **Never-throw violations in M1 code the M1 review missed:** `attachEnergy`
  read `action.target.spot` unguarded (a `null` target THREW out of
  `applyAction` — probe-proven) and retreat's `discardEnergy` lacked
  `Array.isArray` (`{length:1}` passed the length check then `new Set` threw).
  Both now runtime-checked (`BAD_TARGET`; the takePrizes-style array guard).
  Lesson repeated: **every object an action carries needs a shape check, not
  just its leaves.**
- **Name/format parsing vs real catalog data:** `energyProvidesOf` misparsed
  the catalog's own "Basic Darkness/Metal Energy" prints (sv06.5-098/099) to
  Colorless — typed attacks permanently unpayable on legal boards; and the
  schema-documented additive weakness `"+20"` was silently applied as ×2
  (dp5-4 fixture proves it). Fixes: optional "Basic " prefix + the canonical
  `BASIC_ENERGY_TYPES` now lives in **`@luminous/schema`** (builder derives
  its palette from it; Fairy added, Dragon correctly provides nothing), and
  weakness/resistance parse to `DamageModifier` (×N/+N/−N).
- **Data gaps must not guess:** `hp ≤ 0` now reads as the null data gap (a
  literal 0 was instant-KOing undamaged Pokémon on 0-damage attacks).

### Known gaps / traps for M3+
- ~~**`runCheckup` is still a stub.**~~ **Closed by M3** (2026-07-17): the
  shared `knockOut` + `isLethallyDamaged` + `activeTop` now live in
  flow.ts/cards.ts and both attack exits + the checkup use them. Still
  Active-only — M4 bench damage must generalize `knockOut`'s target.
- **`prizeValueOf` returns 1 for everything** — the canonical `Card` has no
  ex/rule-box field because ingest deliberately drops tcgdex's `suffix`
  (wrongly lumped with dp-era extras in `apps/api/src/db/catalog.ts`). The
  multi-prize flow (validation, count clamp, taking N) is already built and
  tested; persisting the suffix at ingest is the single point of change.
- **Energy provision is still name-derived** (special energies conservatively
  provide 1 Colorless). Real fix at ingest: provision as data on the Card.
  Same for weakness/resistance value normalization (`DamageModifier` could be
  computed at ingest) — engine parsing is documented debt.
- **phase ↔ `pending[0]` dual encoding kept** (the parked phase mirrors the
  queue head). Handlers cross-check and reject `PHASE_DESYNC` on mismatch;
  unreachable via the public API today. M3 may collapse to a single encoding
  (park by popping the stage into the phase) if it adds interrupt writers.
- **Sudden death is surfaced, not played out** — simultaneous §14 wins return
  `GameOutcome tie`; an actual sudden-death sub-game is future work.
- **Projection deferrals:** opponent-hand backs use positional ids
  (`opponent-hand-N`) that re-key when the hand shrinks — correct redaction,
  wrong animation identity for opponent plays; fixing needs stable **opaque**
  aliases designed together with P4's server-side filter. `image: null`
  projects `imageUrl: undefined` → the playmat's grey placeholder; nothing
  maps backs/undefined to a card-back texture yet (belongs to the wire-up
  slice). Status conditions + lower stack cards have no CardModel slot.
- ~~The playmat still renders `mockPlaymat.ts`~~ — **closed by the /play
  wire-up (2026-07-17, below).** (Historical note: D17/progress once cited a
  "consumption sketch in the projection module" — no such code block ever
  existed; the consumption guidance is the projection's inline comments.)

## Wire-up as built (2026-07-17) — the playable local game page

**Shape.** `/play` (`src/features/game/GamePage.tsx`) is a hot-seat local
match: pregame (demo decks + saved decks when signed in) → `createGame` →
`LocalMatch` renders **`PlaymatView`** (the presentational shell extracted
from `Playmat.tsx`; the mock at `/simulator` — retitled "Sandbox" — is now a
thin wrapper driver) purely from `projectGameState`. `useLocalGame` owns
`GameState` via a pure reducer over `applyAction` (ok → replace state, append
log via `logFromEvents`, clear `lastError`; err → nonce'd `lastError`); the
hot-seat **viewer follows `waitingOn`** (device flip; `waitingSeatOf` ≡
`phaseViewOf(state, seat).waitingSeat ?? seat` — ONE source, D17). Drags
translate via `moveToAction` (gesture-class routing; the ENGINE is the
authority) and drop affordances obey a **driver-supplied
`PlacementPredicate`** (D19) built by `gamePlacementPredicate` in lockstep
with the translator (property-tested: every afforded drop translates to a
real action). `GameHud` is ONE exhaustive phase switch (coin toss, mulligan
draw, placement, turn panel w/ engine-helper payability, prize/promote
dialogs, game-over overlay), everything gated on `waitingOn === "you"`.
`cardPool` (`src/features/game/cardPool.ts`) builds the engine pool via
`GET /cards/:id` fan-out (D18 — CardBrief deliberately lacks combat blobs);
module-level promise cache, 404s = stable `missing`. Demo decks: 60-card
sv01+sve-era Fire vs Water lists, ids verified live. The **projection now
redacts the opponent's in-play Pokémon during `setup:*`** (positional
`-hidden` ids, no `pokemon` rows — the same filter P4's server applies;
reveal re-keys, same trade as hand backs).

**Browser-verified e2e** (recipe + agent-browser traps in
`.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`): full game — setup drags, hot-seat flips
with setup redaction, energy attach, payability gating, weakness ×2 math,
KO → prize dialog → forced auto-promote, win-by-no-Pokémon overlay; damage
chips confirmed painting above the Pixi canvas (stacking-context walk).

**The React lesson of the session:** two fragment siblings shared
`key={seatKey}` in GameHud — on key change React's `mapRemainingChildren`
dedupes by key, the shadowed old fiber is NEVER deleted, and it stays
mounted-but-orphaned: stale content, **live buttons dispatching real
actions**, zero console errors. Keys among siblings must be unique across
the WHOLE fragment child list, not per slot; the phase-switch composition now
makes the collision structurally impossible. Regression-pinned in
`LocalMatch.dom.test.tsx`.

### /play follow-ups (from the 8-finder/6-verifier review — all verified)
- **P4 blocker (do with P4, not before):** the HUD reads raw `GameState`
  (allowances, `phase.owed`, energy uids — verbatim copies of
  `attack.ts`/`turn.ts` internals for payability/retreat). Online clients
  can never receive GameState; the fix is engine-exported preview predicates
  or a projection "available actions" surface. Acknowledged in-code.
- **Piles are a second render path:** discard-top is a DOM `<img>`; deck-empty
  hides the Pixi back by dropping its anchor. Cards **teleport** to discard
  (KO/retreat/M4 trainers) — needs pile zones in the animation layer's model.
- ~~`CardModel` carries no battle state~~ — **closed by M3** (D21): the
  projection attaches `battle {damage, hp, conditions}`; the side-table and
  its 5-hop prop chain are deleted.
- Perf (minor, verified): `viewLogEntries` re-maps the whole log per action
  (O(n²)); overlay banner/pill timers re-render the board subtree (Pixi sync
  is skipped via board identity — cost is reconciliation + payability
  recompute); per-slot deck→pool fetch pipelining.
- Pregame could reuse `useDeckLibrary` (hand-rolled listDecks effect swallows
  failures silently; judgment call — the hook also fetches /folders).
- Hidden-back re-key on reveal (opponent hand AND setup redaction) pops
  instead of animating — needs the stable-opaque-alias design with P4's
  server filter (pre-existing deferral, now with two call sites).

## M3 as built (2026-07-17) — special conditions, checkup, text-derived effects

**Shape.** The M1-reserved `SpecialConditions` slot (`rotation` ∈
none/asleep/paralyzed/confused, `poisonDamage` counter amount with 0 = not
poisoned, `burned`) is now live on the Active only. The checkup runs entirely
inside `advance`'s `checkup` stage (which now carries the ended `seat`) — **no
new Phase members**: §13 order poison → burn(20 + cure flip) → asleep(wake
flip) → paralysis(ended seat only), each step [endedSeat, other], all flips
threading `rngState`, KOs resolved AFTER the whole batch via the shared
**`knockOut(state, koedSeat, prizeSeat, events)`** (lifted from attack.ts;
prize goes to the KO'd side's opponent) parking on the same ko:* interrupts as
attack KOs — prize stages grouped before promote stages. Double-KO
simultaneous wins resolve by **speculatively applying both KOs + owed prizes
and asking `evaluateWin`** (§14 stays single-sourced) → tie. Gates:
`isImmobilized` (engine-exported; asleep/paralyzed) blocks attack + retreat
(`STATUS_PREVENTS_ATTACK`/`_RETREAT`); Confused attacks flip
(CONFUSION_CHECK; tails → ATTACK_FAILED + 30 self-counters + possible
self-KO prized to the defender + turn ends) through the same shared
`finishAttack` epilogue as the normal exit. Retreat/benching cures (emits
STATUS_CLEARED reason "benched"); a rotation status REPLACES the previous one
with no clear event. Effects: **D20's `deriveAttackEffect`** (5 anchored
sentence patterns → `EffectStep[]`: applyStatus/heal/coinFlipGate) executes
after damage, before the KO check; underivable text keeps ATTACK_EFFECT_SKIPPED
(whose `effect` is null when the text DID derive and only a damage marker was
skipped — the log keys on that). New events: STATUS_APPLIED, STATUS_CLEARED,
COUNTERS_PLACED (poison/burn/confusion), CHECKUP_COIN_FLIP, CONFUSION_CHECK,
ATTACK_FAILED, HEALED, ATTACK_EFFECT_COIN_FLIP. Engine exports added:
`isImmobilized`, `DEFAULT_POISON_DAMAGE`, `StatusName`, `EffectStep`,
`deriveAttackEffect`; internal helpers `isLethallyDamaged` (owns the
hp-null-is-a-data-gap rule) and `activeTop` (the 8×-repeated active/uid/card
preamble).

**Surface (D21).** `CardModel.battle {damage, hp, conditions}` attached by the
projection; SLP/PAR/CNF/BRN/PSN chips (opposite corner from the damage chip;
PSN shows the amount when raised above `DEFAULT_POISON_DAMAGE`); HUD disables
attack+retreat via the engine's `isImmobilized` with a reason line, confusion
gets a note; log rows for all 8 events (shared `STATUS_LABELS`, UI-side);
checkup events ride INSIDE the attack/endTurn action's batch (TURN_ENDED →
ticks/flips → TURN_STARTED in one list — animations must key off post-batch
state, a recovery row can precede the same uid's KNOCKED_OUT). Projection
reports `activeSeat: null` during **between-turns** ko parks (discriminator:
the pending queue has drained the endTurn/checkup tail to bare startTurn);
GamePage's `?? waitingOn` fallback highlights the prize picker. Demo decks:
Numel sv03-031 ×3 (Fire, defender Burn), Luvdisc sv02-047 ×3 (Water, defender
Asleep); Slowpoke's Rest now actually simulates (self-Asleep + heal 30).

### Known gaps / traps for M4+
- **Paralysis has no applied-turn stamp**, so the blanket ended-seat clear is
  wrong for SELF-paralysis at your own turn's end (official wording: cleared
  only if "Paralyzed since the beginning of your last turn"). The deriver
  refuses self-`Paralyzed` (→ skip flag) to keep the wrong case unreachable;
  §12/§13.4 in the rules doc now carry the real conditional. M4 effects that
  self-paralyze need the stamp first.
- **The `EffectStep` interpreter is attack-private by design** (runs after
  damage, targets hardcoded to the two Actives). M4's registry goes ABOVE it
  (`programFor(cardId) ?? deriveAttackEffect(text)` at the one call site) and
  will need mid-effect decision parking, pre-damage `ModifyDamage`, and
  non-Active targets — expect to restructure the interpreter then, not
  extract it now (review adjudicated: premature today).
- **Classic prints are deliberately underivable** ("The Defending Pokémon is
  now …" — sv-era cards say "Your opponent's Active Pokémon"); they keep the
  loud skip flag. Adding the classic pattern is a one-line M4 candidate once
  someone checks the era's timing semantics match.
- `knockOut`/checkup are **Active-only**; M4 bench damage (spread/snipes)
  must generalize the target and revisit the double-KO guard's two-KO framing
  (the speculative-apply shape generalizes; the old hand-rolled guard did
  not).
- `BattleConditions` structurally restates `SpecialConditions` (playmat stays
  engine-free), pinned by a two-way assignability assert in `battleStateOf`.
  When M4 markers widen conditions, **lift the vocabulary to
  `@luminous/schema`** (the BASIC_ENERGY_TYPES precedent).
- Still open from M2: `prizeValueOf` = 1 (ingest suffix column), name-derived
  energy provision, phase↔`pending[0]` dual encoding (checkup added no
  parked-phase writers, so it stands unchanged), opponent-hand/setup reveal
  re-key (P4 opaque-alias design).

## M4 slice 1 as built (2026-07-17) — evolution

**Shape.** New `evolve` action (turn.ts, alongside playBasicToBench/retreat;
`EvolveAction {seat, uid, target: PokemonTarget}`). Places an Evolution card
from hand on the **stack top** of one of the actor's own in-play Pokémon
(Active or Bench). An Evolution card is `evolveFromOf(card) !== null`
(cards.ts — `card.category === "Pokemon" ? card.evolveFrom : null`; `stage`
is not consulted, `evolveFrom` is the ingested datum). Legality, in order:
turnGate → **first-turn ban** → hand/uid → NOT_AN_EVOLUTION → wire target →
resolve target → **EVOLVE_MISMATCH** (the evolution's `evolveFrom` must equal
the target top card's NAME, §10) → **EVOLVE_TOO_SOON**. Carry-over (§10):
damage, Energy, Tools STAY (they ride on the stack, untouched by the spread);
Special Conditions + markers are cleared; `turnPlayed` resets to `state.turn`.
Events: `POKEMON_EVOLVED {from, to, target}` + (iff the Active had conditions)
`STATUS_CLEARED reason:"evolved"` whose `uid` is the NEW top. No KO check —
evolving never KOs (HP only rises; §10 devolution, the one shrink, is
effect-only and out of scope). New error codes NOT_AN_EVOLUTION /
EVOLVE_MISMATCH / EVOLVE_TOO_SOON / FIRST_TURN_EVOLVE; new export
`evolveFromOf`; engineVersion 0.4.0.

**Timing is two checks, deliberately (§4/§10).** `turnPlayed >= state.turn`
covers "not the turn it came into play, nor twice in one turn" (a setup
Pokémon carries turnPlayed **0**, a benched/evolved one the turn it arrived).
That alone can't express "no evolve on your own FIRST turn" — a setup
Pokémon's 0 is < turn 1/2 — so a separate `state.turn === (seat ===
firstPlayer ? 1 : 2)` ban fires first (firstPlayer plays odd turns, so their
first turn is 1 and the other seat's is 2). This is the turn/firstPlayer check
`InPlayPokemon.turnPlayed`'s M1 comment always reserved.

**Surface (web).** No projection change — the projection already reads the
stack **top**, so an evolved Pokémon renders its new card with carried damage
(battle state) and cleared conditions automatically. Drag routing:
`moveToAction`/`gamePlacementPredicate` treat a Pokémon dropped ONTO an own
occupant as an evolve gesture — pokemon→Active and pokemon→**occupied** bench
index → `evolve`; pokemon→a **free** bench slot (the index-less frame
container) stays `playBasicToBench`. This is the SAME indexed-vs-container
disambiguation energy-attach uses (confirmed against the drop layer's
`parsePlacement`: occupied slots carry `data-card-index`, the bench frame
carries none). Fine legality stays the engine's → the error pill (D19,
lockstep property extended in placement.test.ts over a real turn-3 evolvable
board). `logFromEvents` rows for POKEMON_EVOLVED ("evolved X → Y") and the
"evolved" clear. Demo decks carry real lines
(Ember Fuecoco→Crocalor→Skeledirge, Tidal Buizel→Floatzel). Suite 892 → 914.

### Known gaps / traps for the rest of M4
- **Projection identity pops on evolve.** The CardModel id keys off the
  stack-top uid, so evolving swaps basic-uid → evolution-uid and the Pixi
  layer remounts (pop, not a morph) — same class as the hidden-back re-key.
  Animation-layer follow-up; damage/conditions are correct (battle state).
- **The interpreter/registry are still untouched** (evolution is a board
  action, no effect ops) — the D20 traps below stand for the next slices.
- **Rare Candy** (Basic → Stage 2 skip) is an Item, so it waits for the
  trainer registry; the `evolve` action only does adjacent-stage placement.
- `presentStatuses`/first-turn logic are evolve-local; if Abilities add their
  own "is it this seat's first turn" gate, lift a shared helper then.

## Notes for effect authoring at scale
Authoring handlers for many cards is a natural **Workflow** fan-out (one agent per
set/card batch, each verified against the rules doc). Ask the user before
launching one.
