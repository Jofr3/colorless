# Working Conventions

## Guidance, not gospel
These docs are a **living guide**, not a fixed process. You have context the
planning sessions didn't — the actual code, real data, what just broke. Use it:
- **Suggest better/different approaches** when you see them. Don't follow a task
  list off a cliff because it's written down.
- When you deviate: **explain the what + why**, prefer aligning with the user on
  anything significant, then **update the affected doc** and log the change in
  `decisions.md` (with its rationale). Small in-the-flow improvements don't need
  ceremony — just keep the docs honest.
- Locked assumptions and D-numbered decisions are **defaults with reasons**, not
  laws. Revisit any of them freely; the only hard rule is *don't reverse one
  silently* — leave a trail.
- Treat file/symbol references in these docs as **point-in-time** — verify against
  the current code before relying on them.

## Context hygiene (the point of this whole system)
- Load **`progress.md` + the one relevant `workstreams/*.md`** (+ its
  `reference/`). Don't read unrelated workstreams or sweep the repo.
- Prefer facts already written in these docs over re-deriving them.

## Sub-agent / workflow policy
Delegate to sub-agents to keep the main session's context lean:
- **Research** (rules, library docs, API behaviour) → a `general-purpose` agent
  that writes a condensed doc into `reference/` and returns only a summary.
- **Code mapping** ("how does X work today, what's missing") → an **Explore**
  agent (read-only; returns conclusions, not file dumps).
- **Implementation** of a self-contained slice → a `general-purpose` agent with
  a tight spec; it edits files and returns a summary + what to verify.
- **Review** before committing non-trivial work → `/code-review`.
- **Big fan-out** (e.g. authoring effect handlers for many cards, or a broad
  audit) → a **Workflow** (multi-agent). Note: user-triggered/opt-in — ask first.

Rule of thumb: if answering would mean reading many files, delegate it and keep
only the conclusion.

## Code & quality
- TypeScript strict; match the surrounding code's style and comment density.
- **Biome** for lint/format; **Vitest** for tests. Run **`bun run check`**
  (tsc + biome lint + vitest) before calling work done.
- Pure logic gets unit tests (see the many `*.test.ts` in the repo); DOM tests
  opt into jsdom per-file (`// @vitest-environment jsdom`).

## Mutants are DECLARED, not narrated (D211)
Roughly thirty `decisions.md` rows publish a mutant tally — *"13 mutants, 3
survivors"*, *"36 written, 36 killed"* — and until D211 **every one of them was
unreproducible by construction**. Nothing re-ran them and nothing regressed them,
so a slice reporting *"12 killed"* while the suite would actually have passed
three of them was **indistinguishable from an honest one**. Those tallies are
also the only evidence on record that this repo's guards discriminate at all —
which is exactly the class this session proved rots (D200 → D204 → D205 each
shipped a flag that ran, passed, and was worthless).

So: **if you write a mutant tally, the mutants go in `scripts/mutation/mutants.ts`.**

- A mutant is **data**: `{id, decision, what, file, find, replace, expectKilledBy}`.
  `find` is exact source text and **must occur exactly once** — zero matches is an
  ERROR (the code moved; re-transcribe the row), not a skip. That is the row's
  expiry date: *a line number rots silently, a unique string rots loudly.*
- `bun run mutants` applies each one to the real file, runs only
  `expectKilledBy` (≈2 s, versus ≈70 s for the full suite), and restores. Whole
  seeded set: **≈50 s**. `--only` / `--decision` / `--full` / `--list`.
- **A green baseline is a precondition.** If the target suites are already red,
  the harness reports ERROR rather than a verdict — because "the suite went red"
  would otherwise mean nothing. This fires for real when a sibling agent is
  mid-slice in the same tree.
- ⚠️ **A SURVIVOR IS THE INTERESTING OUTPUT, and a legitimate one is declared.**
  Add `survives: {kind, reason}` for the correct-and-unreachable cases this repo
  keeps finding — `equivalent` (D196's declaration snapshot),
  `unreachable-population` (D202's leading `^`: every near-miss the catalog
  prints carries its clause at the start), `unreachable-shape` (D205's
  never-spelled `count: 1`). It is **the opposite of an allowlist**: a declared
  survivor that gets **KILLED** reports `STALE-SURVIVOR` and fails the run,
  because the recorded reason has stopped being true.
- ⚠️ **Restoration never uses git** — not `checkout`, not `stash`. The harness
  holds the original bytes and writes them back, so a tree carrying another
  agent's uncommitted edits comes out the way it went in. Four nets:
  `try/finally`, signal handlers, `process.on("exit")`, and a **journal** at
  `tmp/mutation-journal.json` written *before* the file changes — the only net
  that survives `kill -9`, and the next invocation restores from it and refuses
  to run.

⚠️ **WHAT THE HARNESS DOES NOT PROVE.** It is not coverage, and a green table is
not *"the suite is good"*: it says these specific defects on these specific lines
are caught by these specific suites, today. It does not **generate** mutants —
every row is hand-transcribed, so it can only re-check claims someone already
made, never find the defect nobody thought of. A KILLED verdict reads the **exit
code**, not the failure message, so it proves the suite goes red and not that it
goes red for the right reason. `expectKilledBy` is an author's judgement, and
narrowing it wrongly makes a mutant "survive" a suite that never loaded the line
(`--full` answers that when it matters). And it says nothing about the ~25
decision rows whose tallies are still only prose.

### Where dev scripts sit
`scripts/**`, `apps/api/scripts/ingest.ts` and `packages/schema/scripts/
validate-live.ts` are all **outside `tsc -b`'s project references and outside
vitest's `include` globs**, deliberately: a dev tool has no business in the app's
build graph, and a harness meant to check the suite has no business inside it.
Bun runs the TypeScript directly.
⚠️ **But the Biome half of that precedent does not hold at the repo root.**
`biome.json`'s `files.include` is `["src/**","apps/**","packages/**"]`, so the two
package-local scripts *are* linted while **`scripts/**` is not — Biome processes
zero files there even when the path is passed explicitly**, and `scripts/
catalog-manifest.ts` has been unlinted the whole time. Closing it means editing
both `biome.json` and the three `lint`/`lint:ci`/`check` script arg lists; until
someone does, check root scripts by hand.

## Git / commits
- Branch off `main` for non-trivial work; commit/push only when asked.
- Commit trailer per global config: `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`.

## End-of-session ritual (do not skip)
1. Update `progress.md`: status table + session-log entry + **new resume point**.
2. Record any decision in `decisions.md`.
3. Write anything learned into the right workstream/reference doc so the next
   session doesn't rediscover it.
